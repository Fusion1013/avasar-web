*"Beware our red mark"*
## Overview
The Scarlet Hand is an extremist group of followers of the god [[Saheir, Goddess of Arcana|Saheir]], who they call The Bloodweaver. They have been known to make extensive use of blood magic, through figurines of power. Their symbol is a red hand.
## Notable Members
Members of the sect tend to stay quiet, avoiding attention. They usually form groups in smaller towns, where they can conduct their rituals and ceremonies without attracting attention from the authorities. Most of the members are therefore unknown to the public.
### [[The Bloodmoon Brotherhood]]
Most members of [[The Bloodmoon Brotherhood]] are also members of The Scarlet Hand.
## Figurines of Power
They steal blood from people and infuse it into figurines. They can use the figurines to force people to do things, by causing them pain if they do not follow their orders. There are a number of different types of figurines, all with different purposes and methods of creation.
### Peneben Sculptures
A smaller figurine crafted from the bones of the victim. It is typically crafted using bones from an appendage, most often toes or fingers. The bone is then carved into to create something that resembles the victim. The closer the figurine is in appearance, the more powerful it becomes. Runes can also be inscribed upon the surface of the figurine, to focus its power towards a certain goal. Peneben Sculptures are typically used as a focus for magic targeted at the victim. It can amplify the power of a spell, or in some cases even warp its effects depending on what runes were used to create the figurine.
### Horned Owl
The horned owl is a rare type of figurine, used to gain insight about a certain person. They are rarely used due to their relative complexity and the dangers they pose to the user. If created correctly they can be quite powerful, giving deep access to the victims mind. If used or created incorrectly, they could corrupt either the user's mind, the victim's mind, or both. The figurine is typically made from onyx and takes the form of a horned owl, which is what has given it its name.
### Wax Statuettes
Small statuettes created using wax. The wax is usually mixed with some bodily fluid from the victim, though usually blood as it is the most potent. Can be used to inflict pain onto the victim by burning parts of the statuette. They are not capable of killing, only harming, though victims have been known to end their own life due to the immense pain.
