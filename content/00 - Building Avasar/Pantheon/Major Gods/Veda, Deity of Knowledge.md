## Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Gnosis, Plane of Knowledge]].
## Domain
Veda’s domain contains all aspects of finding, preserving, and distributing knowledge.
## Symbology

## Worship
A lot of the temples act like schools and libraries, and are open to the public. A lot of followers believe that knowledge should not be restricted, that it should be free to everyone. Many followers might be adventurers that specialize in finding knowledge, such as searching for old books, documenting new findings in the wilds, etc. A less popular belief is that knowledge should not be shared with those outside the circle, but that it should be hoarded. While many priests believe that all knowledge should be shared and open to the public, they still understand that knowledge can be dangerous and that they have to abide by the laws set up by the governments surrounding them. To circumvent this, some have constructed secret libraries that share some more ‘forbidden’ knowledge.
