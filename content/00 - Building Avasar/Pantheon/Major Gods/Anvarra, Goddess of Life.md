# Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[Vylmat, Plane of Life]].
# Domain
Anvarra acts as a representation of life as a whole. Anything which is considered to be alive, besides what falls under the domain of [[Verdus, Nature|Verdus]], is what she resides over. This includes anything which would be seen as a warped or corrupted version of life, such as undeath.
# Symbology
Even though nature is not a part of the domain of Anvarra, it is often used as a symbol to represent life. One common symbol is the Tree of Life and Death, which takes the form of a twisted tree, bursting with leaves on one side, dead on the other. It is supposed to symbolize life on one side and death on the other, with all that binds it in the middle.

Another popular symbol is the hourglass, reminding followers that your natural life is finite, that it one day will end. But just as with an hourglass, that might not be the end. A turn of the hourglass can start another cycle, just as the death of a being can start another cycle of life.
# Worship
Many followers of Anvarra do not believe that undeath is a ‘bad’ thing. Some even believe that undeath is the natural progression of life. Temples to Anvarra are often dedicated to healing and restoration, and some extreme sects even help others achieve undeath. These rituals are seen as means to preserve life and are often seen as forms of worship. While some followers use healing magic to aid those already injured, some believe in preventing damage from occurring in the first place. They often act as peacekeepers for their local communities, with these goals often overlapping with those of followers of Irellia. Most followers are against unnatural deaths, the definition of which differs from group to group. A lot of followers are vegetarians.
