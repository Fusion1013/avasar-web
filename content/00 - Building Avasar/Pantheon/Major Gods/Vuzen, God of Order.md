## Worship
Followers are commonly found working within the government, within law and order, as judges, city guards, lawmakers, and other officials. Temples are few and far between, with most followers choosing to show their devotion by going out in the world and establishing and maintaining order. The few temples that do exist are well organized, and part of a well regulated system. There are very few temples that exist outside this order. They have a very structured hierarchy of priests.
