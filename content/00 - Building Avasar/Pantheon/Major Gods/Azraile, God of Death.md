## Overview
One of the major [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], attuned to [[The Dark Beyond]].
## Domain
Azraile represents all aspects of death. He acts as a foil to the domain of Anvarra. He acts to ensure the inevitable end of every mortal life and guides their spirits to wherever they may reside. His domain also includes ways of causing death, such as murder.
## Symbology
## Worship
Many temples to Azraile provide burial services and have many different burial rites and ceremonies that they can perform. Most temples are built in or close to a graveyard, with followers tending the graves. They believe that death is a natural part of life, that death is the next step and that preventing it is a perversion of its nature. As such, they do not believe in undeath or prolonging life through unnatural means. Some of the most extreme followers might resort to killing those they believe have violated the natural cycle of life and death.
