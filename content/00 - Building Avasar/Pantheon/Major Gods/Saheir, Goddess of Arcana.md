## Worship
Many believe that dreams are a way to interface with the gods. There are many rites and ceremonies surrounding dreams, where they try to get closer to Saheir. Temples can also provide this service to members of other beliefs, to allow them to get closer to their gods. Followers are often scholars that focus on the study and usage of both arcane and divine magic. Most followers do not believe that such a thing as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ magic exists and instead think that magic is a neutral force.
