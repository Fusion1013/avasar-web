## Domain

## Symbology

## Worship
Followers believe in truth, absolute truth. Some more extreme followers believe that one should always tell the truth, no matter the consequences that might come from it or who might get hurt by it. Worshippers can commonly be found within law - as judges, investigators, or similar occupations where finding the truth is a core theme. Temples can provide services where patrons can come and confess, a place where people can tell the truth without consequence. There are temples that can provide services of enchantment magic, where someone could be forced to tell the truth through magical means. Some more extreme followers might believe in truth at any cost, which could mean torturing someone for the truth in rare circumstances. Illusion magic is generally frowned upon but tolerated, though some temples and individuals go out of their way to prevent anyone from using it.
