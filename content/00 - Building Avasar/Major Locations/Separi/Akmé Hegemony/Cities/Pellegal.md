## Overview
Pellegal is the premier - and only - trading city in the [[Siar Wilds]]. Nestled in the northern lowlands of Siar, ships can be seen sailing to and from its harbours containing all manner of goods, carefully controlled and recorded by the [[Akmé Hegemony Overview|Hegemony]]. Its most visible landmark is the [[Dawn’s Calling Lighthouse]], a colossal structure beckoning sailors to come and partake in [[Akmé]]’s grace and beauty.
## History
Pellegal was the first city founded in Siar, as the initial landing point for the [[Archons]]’ original expedition to their promised land. It quickly became a small, bustling port, letting other settlers in freely. Its population quickly grew, and Pellegal became the de facto capital of the Hegemony.
