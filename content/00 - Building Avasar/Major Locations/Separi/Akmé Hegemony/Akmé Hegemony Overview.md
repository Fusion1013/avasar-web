## Overview

## History
The Akmé Hegemony was founded as the result of [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan]] refugees fleeing persecution across the seas. They arrived in the [[Siar Wilds]], a mostly uninhabited area beset by [[Planes Overview#Planar Portals|Planar Portals]] that made it wildly dangerous. But with their magical prowess they managed to tame this wilderness, make it “orderly” as they’d put it.

A hierarchy emerged, with a council of elder witches and druids was established, ruling over the Siar Wilds and overseeing the containment of [[Planes Overview#Planar Portals|Planar Portals]]. Nobody knows how or why, but eventually, they began appearing in public not as their mortal selves, but one by one, as large living statues.

There were, and still are, 6 council members: [[Nia the Faithless]], [[Miphene of the Starless Sea]], and [[Pyal Thunderpath]] were of a faction on the council which wanted to ban the worship of gods outright. [[Hirae The Seeker]], [[Epher Oakhall]], and [[Tryphone of the Twisting Paths]] all staunchly oppose their three other peers, believing that worship should be allowed under strict conditions tightly controlled by the Hegemony, so as to “lead the people along the right path.” All of these figures are known now as Archons.

The Hegemony gets its name from the being which assisted in taming its wilds. No common folk know exactly what [[Akmé]] is, but everybody knows it is powerful. [[Akmé]] has eyes across the [[Siar Wilds]]. It sees all, knows all. [[Akmé]] might as well be the forest itself, in most peoples’ eyes.
## Major Cities
### [[Pellegal]]
[[Pellegal]] is the Northernmost city in the [[Siar Wilds]], serving as the Hegemony’s main port city for what little trade goes in and out. [[Pellegal]] is where [[Miphene of the Starless Sea]] and [[Hirae the Seeker]] make their homes. [[Pellegal]] is also home to most of Siar’s traders, a majority of its artisans and artists, and has the most access to foreign technology.
### [[Taise]]
[[Taise]] holds bountiful minerals, particularly gemstones, which are scarce everywhere else on [[Separi Overview|Separi]]. It also houses the greatest places of learning, libraries, universities and such, in the Siar Wilds. [[Pyal Thunderpath]] and [[Epher Oakhall]] reside in [[Taise]], overseeing the city which is increasingly divided between highly educated elites and miners, living as essentially serfs.
### [[Onaia]]
[[Onaia]] is a great agricultural power, exporting grain and other agricultural products not just to the rest of Siar but all across [[Separi Overview|Separi]], as traders buy it for relatively cheap from border towns and distribute it across the continent. [[Nia the Faithless]] and [[Tryphone of the Twisting Paths]] govern over [[Onaia]], ever butting heads over religious matters, mainly whether it should be allowed on a large scale.
