# History of the City-State of Drufali

[[City-State of Drufali Overview|The City-State of Drufali]] has a tumultuous history that traces its roots back to its origins as part of the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]], a powerful kingdom ruled by a monarch. However, the city-state's path diverged when a civil war erupted due to a succession crisis within the ruling dynasty. With the king failing to name a clear successor, his sons and other factions within the kingdom clashed in a bid for the crown.
