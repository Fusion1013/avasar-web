# Sakhar Outpost (Saak-har)
## Overview
A city / township in the south south-west region of [[Raazhan Dominion Overview|Raazhan]], close to the mountain range on the left hand side of the region. The Sakhar Outpost is mostly known for its guarded path to the quarries in the mountains, which are mainly used to gain high value building rocks like marble and granite.

Sakhar would likely be a collection of ramshackle buildings surrounding a few grander and more proper buildings, all encapsulated in a series of towering runic obelisks. These obelisks hold together a shielding spell that protects the township against the dangerous sandstorms that ravage the area nearby, which is maintained by a powerful mage that is one of the commanding powers of the city.
