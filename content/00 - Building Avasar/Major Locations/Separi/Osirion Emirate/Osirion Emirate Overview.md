*"The Blessed of Anvarra"*

**Government:** 
**Languages:** [[Kharinthi]]
## Overview

## History
The Osirion Emirate was created on the continent of [[Separi Overview|Separi]], where a vast desert covered a majority of the region. For some time, the southernmost parts of this desert was occupied by small towns near scattered oases. No major power was able to form in this region due to its inhospitability.

This factor was soon changed by a powerful cleric of [[Anvarra, Goddess of Life]]. They along with their people had been suffering due to the water at their village drying up. After praying many times to their goddess, this cleric was given instructions for a ritual to solve their plight.

On the eve of a [[Sovereign Eclipse]], this cleric and his followers performed a special rite in a desolate region of the desert. As the [[Cosmology Overview#Avasar|moons of Avasar]] began to eclipse the sun, a geyser of water began to shoot out of the ground. This continuous flow of water eventually formed into a lake and river, causing the region around these new landmarks to be hospitable for civilization.

The cleric who performed this rite became a leader of their people, and eventually formed the Osirion Emirate in 847 APC. [[Osirion Emirate Overview#The Undying Emir|The Undying Emir]] continues to rule over this nation over 500 years later in 1378 APC.
## Religion
Religion is seen as an integral part of life within the Emirate. The different clerical orders in the nation oversee different governmental positions and duties.

The vast majority of citizens in the Emirate are religious in some way. The most common deity of worship is [[Anvarra]], but all of the major deities have followings within the state. It is not a crime to not be a devout worshiper of any god; however, since many religious groups run the different organizations across the Emirate, it can make having a decent living difficult.
## Major Cities
### [[Nevaire]]
[[Nevaire]] is the capital city of the Osirion Emirate.
### [[Hecar]]
[[Hecar]] is a large city to the south of [[Osirion Emirate Overview#Pylon Lake|Pylon Lake]]. It is on an island in the center of the [[Osirion Emirate Overview#Pylon River|Pylon River]]. [[Hecar]] is seen as a major holy city; the original settlement led by the Undying Emir became the city of [[Hecar]]. Its proximity to the lake leads to it having a large presence from the religious orders, even more than in the [[Nevaire|Capital]].
### [[Delfum]]
[[Delfum]] is a large city in the Emirate on the southern coast of the continent near the delta of the [[Osirion Emirate Overview#Pylon River|Pylon River]]. [[Delfum]] acts as a major trading hub for the Emirate.
## Major Regions
### Pylon Lake
Pylon Lake is the large magical lake in the center of the Osirion Emirate. Despite a lack of rainfall in the region, the lake always remains full.

Pylon Lake is seen as a holy site for the Osirion Emirate.
### Pylon River
Pylon River is a large river running from [[Osirion Emirate Overview#Pylon Lake|Pylon Lake]] to the southern coasts of [[Separi Overview|Separi]].

The region around this river remains fertile due to the blessed water flowing from the lake. Crops grown in this fertile land are more resilient to weather changes and grow much larger than normal. For these reasons, a majority of the Emirate’s population lives around this river.
### The Khatir Dunes
The Khatir Dunes refers to the entire desert on the continent of [[Separi Overview|Separi]]. This arid landscape is considered quite dangerous; it’s full of dangerous creatures and lacking many sources of water. Towns and villages that do exist here either rely on the magical creation of water or being located near a water source, such as the Pylon River or an underground lake.
### Jefel Plains
These plains consist of a region in the south-western parts of the Emirate. It is the only region under the control of the Emirate not within a desert.
## Major People
### The Undying Emir
The Undying Emir has been the ruler of the Osirion Emirate since its creation. They are seen as a mysterious figure; no regular civilian knows what they look like or what their true name is. The Emir is also seen as a champion of [[Anvarra]].
## Regional Ancestries
### The Lakespawn
Lakespawn refers to a group of blue-skinned people within the Emirate. Each Lakespawn is formed in the Pylon Lake and rises out of it at a young age. Lakespawn are seen as walking symbols of the gift Anvarra gave to the people of the nation. It is common for Lakespawn to be brought into a clerical order.
## Major Organizations
### The Sects
Each of the main deities of Avasar has a sect within the Orision Emirate. These organizations are led by a High Cleric. These clerics are said to be chosen directly by what god they represent.

Sects play a large part in the society of the Emirate. A majority of people belong to one. Members within a sect normally take on a role befitting of the sect’s domain they are in.
