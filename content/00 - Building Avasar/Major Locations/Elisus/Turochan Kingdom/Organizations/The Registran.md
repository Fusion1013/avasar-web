# The Registran
## Overview
An order of elite knights within the kingdom used to protect the royal family and carry out precarious tasks. Specialized in techniques for taking down magic users, whether it be to kill or capture them. The organization is currently led by Sir Marc Valerrus, a loyal servant of the Crown.
## History
Not long after the Kingdom’s creation, it began to face its largest threat: the remnants of the mages who had previously occupied Taundor were attempting to regain control of the region. It was during this time that the Registran was officially formed. Under the leadership of Turot, the first leader of the Kingdom, the organization became an elite group of knights that specialized in combating magic users. Their training and equipment were specially designed to counter the abilities of these dangerous individuals, and they were chosen for their exceptional skills in combat and their unwavering loyalty to the Kingdom.

As the years passed, the number of magic users in the Kingdom dwindled, and the Registran found themselves with less to do. To adapt to these changing circumstances, the organization expanded its duties to include the protection of the Royal Family.  They soon became a familiar sight in the capital city of Velus, where they could be seen guarding the palace and accompanying members of the Royal Family on official business.
Even with their expanded role in recent years, the Registran has not forgotten its roots. Despite rules continuing to relax against the use of the arcane and divine, the Registran continues to maintain their exceptional skills to be used against magic users. Many of their calls to arms have been in combating the resurgence of the Occultum, which was thought to have been previously neutralized. Additionally, they continue to serve in ceremonial capacities, such as during parades and special holidays. The Registran has remained a vital part of the Turochan Kingdom, and its members are revered as some of the finest warriors on the continent.

## Goals and Accomplishments
### The Master Mage Slayers
The Registran’s specialty has always been in handling magic users. For much of the organization’s existence, their main goal was the elimination or capture of any mages within the Kingdom that were discovered. However, this goal has shifted since King Aulus II began to lift restrictions on the existence of magic users in the Kingdom. This new goal is to take care of mages seen as dangerous or against the Crown in any way. To accomplish this, they use a mixture of methods; these can range from their warrior's impeccable skill to both magical and non-magical devices.

Overall, the Registran have been fairly successful with this goal throughout the history of the Turochan Kingdom. Many magic users, especially those who are unable to properly control their abilities, feared that any day they could be targeted during the times before King Aulus II. Even now, those who wish to use the arcane or the divine in ways unapproved by the Crown could be quickly dealt with.
### Protectors of the Turochan Name
Another duty that the Registran took on after the early days of the Kingdom was the protection of the Turochan family. Closely related descendants to the nation's founder, such as the Royal Family, are closely guarded by this organization. Their residences are always under close watch, such as the Royal Palace within Velus. These mighty knights are also seen by the sides of family members whenever they must travel outside of their abodes.

Most attempts to harm or murder anyone protected by the Registran have been thwarted. The organization excels at their duties as personal  defenders of the Royal Family.
### Keepers of Tradition
Knights of the Registran, especially the Sentinels, are often used in different official ceremonies and traditions. This can range from large events that take place once a year to weekly ceremonies.

One of the most prominent of these is the Salvus Procession. This event takes place on the Eve of Salvus, a holiday marking when the island of Taundor was thrown at the continent by the gods. Over the course of an hour, these warriors march to different memorials across the city of Velus. The event is completely silent, with only a few members speaking after arriving at certain memorial locations. This tradition began not long after the founding of the Turochan Kingdom to remember the tragedy.
## Establishments
### The Locatis Citadel
The Locatis Citadel is a large compound within the city of Velus. This walled off area on a small plateau near the royal palace acts as the headquarters for the Registran. The entire complex is surrounded by imposing walls topped in ballistas for defending against any attackers. A large, sturdy bridge connects this smaller plateau directly to the royal palace. While there are multiple other entrances to the compound, they are hidden and kept secret. The Citadel is considered to be the most secure section of Velus in case of an attack.

Within the walls of this complex are two main buildings: a smaller side tower and a larger stone fortress. Smaller tents and buildings are seen scattering the grounds. The land within the Citadel is mostly used for training activities; it is littered with archery ranges, practice fighting rings, and more.

The smaller side tower acts as the headquarters for the Bracchium Artifex. It is around four stories tall and contains a basement of two floors. The upper two floors of the tower acts to store raw materials and components required for their crafting. It also contains some living quarters for the artificers that work there. The first and second floors are the Artifex's main working space. It is used to create all of the armor, weapons, and tools the Registran uses. The basement floors contain the heavily guarded vaults holding any completed magical items created by the Artifex. It also connects to the underground sections of the main complex.

The large stone building in the center of the Citadel is the headquarters for all of the knights of the Registran. The complex rises to three stories at its tallest and goes fairly deep into the ground below it. The above ground floors contain things such as armories, barracks, living quarters, canteen, defensive positions, and general storage. Everything underground is considered to contain more secretive things. It includes more defensive positions, a small prison, and more.
## Faction Subdivisions
### Bracchium Artifex
More commonly just called the Artifex, this branch is a group of incredibly skilled artificers and crafters chosen by the leadership of the Registran. None of the members of this branch are considered knights of the Registran; they are generally not proficient in any forms of combat. Instead, this branch focuses on crafting the weapons and tools required by the knights in the pursuit of their duties.

Traditionally, all work done by the Artifex was non-magical. Whenever the group was first established, they only crafted non-magical items. However, the magic users that remained in the nation after Turot officially took over began to grow more clever. Simply put, items just being well crafted was no longer enough for the knights to complete their duties. Because of this, members of the Artifex became the only group allowed to craft items imbued with magic not long after the founding of the Kingdom. However, their members were still extremely limited in this aspect. They could only create certain items that could only be used by the Registran. Members were forbidden to teach anyone else this knowledge, unless they were brought into the branch for their skills. Retiring from this position was often difficult; former members of the Artifex were under constant surveillance, and sometimes even killed to prevent their knowledge from falling into someone else's hands. The number of these magical crafters was also quite limited. Never has there been more than five at a time. With King Aulus II’s relaxations of these laws, some members of the Artifex have left to pursue their craft in a more open way. Often, these former members are despised by those that stayed, often being considered traitors to the cause.

The only building associated with this branch is a small tower within the Locatis Citadel in Velus. This is where many of the magical and non-magical gear of the Registran is created. Underneath is also a well-secured vault, which holds many of these items.
### Bracchium Sentinel
More commonly referred to as the Sentinels, this branch of warriors is one of the two main groupings of knights in the Registran. Knights who are assigned to the Sentinels generally spend most of their time in the city of Velus. Here, they act as protectors of the king, palace, and members of the royal family. They are a common sight to see within the inner walls of the city. Members of the Sentinels also carry out many different ceremonial duties. Despite their less active role compared to the Caedens, members of the Sentinels are still incredibly skilled warriors.

Originally, there were not multiple branches containing knights in the Registran; their main task was only to hunt down any remaining arcane and divine magic users within the nation. However, as the numbers of mages dwindled over the years, the Registran was left with much less work to do. This led to the knights being split into two distinct branches; those that continued out their duties of keeping the nation free of magic and those that were now assigned to protect the King and his family. These newer duties also slowly began to incorporate the different ceremonial aspects commonly associated with the Registran to this day.

Of the knights of the Registran, this branch contains around ⅔ of them. In total, the Sentinels average around 120-150 members at any time.
### Bracchium Caedens
More commonly referred to just as the Caedens, this smaller grouping of deadly knights specializes in one thing: standing toe-to-toe with any magic uses they come across. Depending on the current task they are assigned, these warriors specialize in tracking, detaining, and killing practitioners of magic.

Originally, the Registran was formed specifically for this purpose. However, the knights were quite good at their job and caused the number of magic users in the nation to dwindle. After the knights were split into two different branches, the Caedens kept those that were the most zealous. It’s said that some members of this branch have come to enjoy this job. However, many members of the Caedens despise the policies of King Aulus II. The branch no longer has as much to do, causing more of their members to be reassigned to the Sentinels. They no longer can go around killing any magic users, but only those that truly are a threat. Due to the reduction in size of this branch, those that stayed were those with the most zeal for their job. However, with the resurgence of the Occultum, many of the members who were dissatisfied with their lack of assignments yet again had something to do.

Of the knights of the Registran, this branch contains around 1⁄3 of them. In total, the Caedens average around 60-75 members at any time.
