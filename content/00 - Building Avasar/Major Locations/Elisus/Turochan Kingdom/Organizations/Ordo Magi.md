# Ordo Magi
*"Imperium Magicae"*
## Overview
A group of arcane magic users created after the relaxation of rules against magic. Works on stigmatizing the use of magic and properly training a new generation of mages in [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|The Kingdom]]. Operates the only legal magical academy within [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|The Kingdom]]. Many people within [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|The Kingdom]], especially those that are older and lived through the war, heavily oppose this faction. Admission into the faction along with their magic school is heavily regulated by the Crown. Members are also closely watched by agents of the Crown to ensure they follow the new regulations. Founded and led by [[Lady Sortelle Armon]].
## History
The Ordo Magi was created by [[Lady Sortelle Armon]] 35 years ago in her youth. For part of the organization’s history, it acted in secret. During this time period, they would assist those born with innate magical abilities in the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]] on how to safely control their powers. Since their members only included a few trusted individuals at the time, they did not largely impact the rest of the Kingdom. Many of the members during this time, including its former leaders, were caught and executed by the Crown. However, after [[King Aulus Turochan II]] began to loosen restrictions on having magic users within the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Kingdom]], they were able to make themselves known. The group began to focus on convincing others to become less hostile against magic users and show the benefits it could bring to a society. They also were allowed to open the only school dedicated to the learning of magic, though less than 30 people have ever attended. Although restrictions are continuing to loosen, membership into this organization and their school is heavily regulated, with members having reported themselves being under constant surveillance.

## Goals and Accomplishments
### Destigmatize Magic
The main goal of the Ordo Magi since the relaxation of laws against magic users has been to destigmatize the use of magic in any way. They accomplish this in a number of ways. Something they often focus on is showing the populace exactly how magic can be used as a positive in society; whether it be to help in advancing technology or protecting the common citizen. They also use their political power to try and persuade those in higher society, such as nobles.

So far, the Ordo Magi has been successful in making some of the population be less afraid of magic. Around half of citizens within the largest cities of the nation have been shown to either be neutral or for the use of magic. However, their influence has not yet reached many of the smaller towns throughout [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|The Kingdom]]. There, a large majority of people still are adverse to the policies of the new king.

The organization has been able to persuade a few noble families to switch their support for the use of magic, including the Armon family the organization’s founder comes from. Doing this has led to less pressure on the king from the nobles for his radical policies.
### Teaching the Next Generation
A secondary goal of the organization is to train those who either have innate magical abilities or promise to learn such abilities within their school. They have been successful in creating the only legal institute for learning magic, though it is heavily restricted. Admission into the school is very tight; while current regulations in the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]] allow for them to teach, it only allows for a very small number of students to be admitted every year. Because of this, only those with the most promise are admitted. Those that attend the school are taught how to properly use their abilities in a way that would benefit the Kingdom.
## Establishments
### Constitio Mystica Prodigorium
This main facility is also known as the Institute of Mystical Prodigies. This is a small campus located within the city of [[Velus]] surrounded by high stone walls. Due to many attempted break-ins by their adversaries, the compound hires private guards to ensure the safety of their students and faculty. Overall, the establishment is quite small; the walls surround an area of only a few thousand square feet (few hundred square meters). Inside is one medium-sized building connecting to an eight story tower. The outside of the building contains shrubbery, planters of flowers, and some seating areas.

A majority of the school within the building is inside of the large tower. The tower contains multiple classrooms, a dormitory, areas for meals and recreation, and practice rooms. For the safety of the students, they mostly remain within the facility at all times. However, they have some specialized days where they can explore the rest of the city with supervision.

The building connected to the tower contains a few different rooms: offices, the archive, some miscellaneous and storage rooms, and a larger assembly hall. Generally, the three faculty members of the school do not spend the night there, unless they are working on a project and plan not to sleep.

The Institute divides its students into three categories which are taught by one of the three leaders of the Ordo Magi. [[Lady Sortelle Armon]] is the head of the Inherited Magic program. This includes any students who were born with magical abilities or obtain them without learning them, such as sorcerers. [[Augur Cato Elgor]] specializes in teaching someone magical abilities, such as wizards. 

While the Institute remains the only legal place of magical learning in [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|The Kingdom]], it still has to follow a long list of restrictions. Limitations on how many students they can admit every year means they have to be incredibly selective on who they allow in. While these limits have gotten less strict over the past few years, it’s only an improvement from around 4 people to 8. In total, the Institute can have no more than 30 students at a time.
