## Eve of Salvus
**Alternative Names:** Eve of Salvation, Eve of Survival, The Salvus
**Date:** TBD

### Interpretation
Salvus is used as a term to refer to the event of [[Taundor]] being shoved into the continent of [[Elisus Overview|Elisus]]. Over time, the original interpretation of this term has been lost, with different people or groups coming to two main conclusions on what it meant. This holiday takes place on the day before this event happened.

Salvation Interpretation - Some believed that this event is what saved them from a worse fate. However, the Salvus was not the gods giving them salvation from the mages. The people realized that the divine would hurt them just as much as the arcane had. By creating a nation free from all forms of magic, the people had given themselves salvation from what magic may intend to harm them.

Survival Interpretation - Others believe this holiday is in celebration of the fact that they were the ones to survive; those that still remained after the island of Taundor was crashed into the continent showed that they were resilient. The survivors of this tragedy were able to mold such a devastating event into a show of strength and unity.

The holiday reflects both of these interpretations through various traditions and festivities.
### Ceremonies
These ceremonies are only performed in [[Velus]]. Sometimes, other cities will hold smaller scale traditions.
#### The Salvus Procession
This tradition is hosted by the members of the Sentinel branch of [[Turochan Kingdom Overview#The Registran|The Registran]]. It is used to tell the history of the Salvus. Starting at the palace as the sun rises, the group will march throughout the entire city. Along the way, the group will stop at multiple monuments and memorials throughout the city that depict certain moments during the event. Over the course of an hour, the story of [[Taundor]] is told in small pieces during these stops. Citizens are encouraged to join the procession. However, everyone who joins is asked to remain silent. Only designated members of [[Turochan Kingdom Overview#The Registran|The Registran]] who are telling the story speak during this event. Bystanders do their best to enforce this silence. The procession culminates in Salvus Square, not far from the palace. Here, the day of the Salvus is told, along with a message about remaining strong in adversity and not relying on the gods to help those that ask for it. The procession then heads back towards the palace, where the Word of the King is held.
#### Word of the King
The Word of the King is an annual speech given by the current king of the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]]. These speeches have varied greatly over the years, depending on the current king's interpretation of the Salvus and what matters are currently relevant to the nation. However, this event is always held after the Procession at the palace.
### Festivities
After the traditional ceremonies are completed in the morning, the holiday offers many forms of entertainment and excitement.
#### Sweet Treats
Sugary treats similar to dalgona have the shape of the island of [[Taundor]] pressed into them. Try and separate it without breaking the island apart!

Different sweets such as pies and pastries are commonly sold on this day. Traditionally, these will use nuts or dates, but sweets with other fruits and berries are also common.
#### Entertainment
Many common festival activities take place throughout the day, such as contests and parades.

This holiday is known for its competitions between warriors. [[Velus]], already having a very popular scene of competitive gladiatorial combat, has some of its largest events on this day of the year. Those that attend expect to see fights between individuals, groups, and dangerous beasts. Some of the most anticipated fights of the year are commonly scheduled to take place on this day.
#### Midnight Blackout
At midnight on this holiday, lights across the nation are simultaneously snuffed out. 
This event is held as a tradition between many people across the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]]. At midnight, whenever the day of Salvus has finally arrived, many people get blackout drunk together. This originally began as a smaller scale local tradition that has spread throughout the years.
