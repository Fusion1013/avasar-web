## History
Cato Elgor was not originally from the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]]; he was born in the [[Raazhan Dominion Overview|Raazhan Dominion]]. He was shown to be quite a gifted learner of arcane magic, and was an apprentice to a wizard named Corin Rahel. He focused specifically on the research of magic and on using divination. However, the [[Raazhan Dominion Overview|Raazhan Dominion]] was continuing to lose influence in the region. After his mentor died of old age, Cato felt he had no reason to stay in a dying nation. He saw how the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]] was beginning to relax their regulations against magic, and decided to find other gifted students like he was there. He joined the Ordo Magi shortly after his arrival, and became its first member who had learned magic instead of being born with it innately.

Cato Elgor was born in the [[Raazhan Dominion Overview|Raazhan Dominion]], a nation that welcomed the practice of magic. As a child, Cato displayed an exceptional talent for learning arcane magic. He had a natural curiosity for the unknown which led him to becoming the apprentice apprentice to a renowned wizard named Corin Rahel.

Cato spent years under Corin's tutelage, honing his skills and studying the mysteries of magic. He found his love of cataloging research and history of magic while narrowing his study to that of divination. However, as the Dominion was beginning to grow unstable. The nation no longer had control over some of its cities, and Cato feared it could fall apart in the near future. When his mentor died of old age, Cato knew it was time to leave for new horizons.

He heard rumors that the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]] was beginning to allow some magical practitioners into the nation. Cato knew there must be so much untapped potential for arcane learners within the nation. After all, generations had gone by where people gifted with the ability to learn like he did were prohibited from doing so. Despite the possible risks that these rumors were false, Cato Elgor sailed off to the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]] in hope of finding a new home.

Once he arrived, he quickly found out that the rumors were true. Cato joined the [[Ordo Magi]] and became its first member who had learned magic instead of being born with it innately. He was eager to share his knowledge of the arcane with new gifted pupils, and began to work with [[Lady Sortelle Armon]] in finding such individuals within the Kingdom.

Cato Elgor teaches how people can learn to use magic within the school. He also acts as the main archivist for the small collection of books on magical knowledge the organization possesses.
