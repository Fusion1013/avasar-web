# Master Livian Orthun
## Overview

## Appearance
## History
Livial Orthun was originally born in [[Virston]]. Here he became an expert craftsman and non-magical artificer. Due to his incredible skill, he was chosen by [[Turochan Kingdom Overview#The Registran|The Registran]] to personally craft items for them. Here, he was allowed to learn how to magically enchant items, as long as he swore to never spread this knowledge to others and only craft items for [[Turochan Kingdom Overview#The Registran|The Registran]]. Here he helped in making devices to counter mages and make their weapons and armor more durable. As [[King Aulus Turochan II]] began to relax laws against magic, Livian was allowed to create different magic items and sell them to approved recipients. He is the newest member of the Ordo Magi with a high ranking position.

Livian Orthun's life began in [[Virston]], where he was born and raised. As a young man, he discovered his talent for craftsmanship and became an expert non-magical artificer. He honed his skills and gained a reputation for creating high-quality items that were both beautiful and functional.

Eventually, Livian's talents caught the attention of [[Turochan Kingdom Overview#The Registran|The Registran]], who chose him to join the ranks of their personal craftsmen. This was a great honor for Livian, as [[Turochan Kingdom Overview#The Registran|The Registran]] was known for being very selective in their choice of artisans. Under the guidance of his new peers, Livian learned the art of magically enchanting items. However, he was sworn to secrecy and could only use this knowledge to craft items for [[Turochan Kingdom Overview#The Registran|The Registran]].
Livian's talents proved to be invaluable to [[Turochan Kingdom Overview#The Registran|The Registran]], especially when it came to creating devices that could counter mages. Livian was able to make weapons and armor that were more durable and effective against magical attacks. He also assisted in the creation of charms that warded off attempts to charm or frighten its wearer. However, Livian always felt his talents were restrained by the policies of the Crown.

As King Aulus began to relax laws against magic, Livian was granted more freedom to create different types of magic items and sell them to approved recipients. However, he was judged by his peers for this choice. Eventually, he was pressured to leave [[The Registran]] and decided he could teach what he learned at the [[Ordo Magi]]. Master Livian Orthun became the last of the main three teachers within the [[Ordo Magi]] to join the organization.
