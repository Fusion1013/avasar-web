# Sir Teroshe Furvere
## Overview
Sir Teroshe Furvere is the leader of the Bracchium Caedens, a subdivision of [[The Registran]] that specializes in dealing with magic users. Like many of the other Caedens, Teroshe is considered to be a zealot and quite brutal in his line of work. He is both feared and respected by his subordinates for his cunning tactics and gruesome methods. The unofficial title of “The Duskbringer'' is often used to refer to him.
## Appearance
Teroshe is a pale human male in his early 30s. He has very short and well kept brown hair and brown eyes. He also has a fairly small but well trimmed beard. He is incredibly tall, around 6ft 3 (1.9 meters) and is incredibly brawny. He is commonly seen in the attire of higher ranking members of the Registran.
## History
Teroshe was born in the town of [[Nyrif]], where he was the youngest of two other sisters. His mother and father were secret worshippers of [[Veda, Deity of Knowledge]]. Through their devotion, his parents had some minor clerical powers. As Teroshe and his siblings continued to grow up, they were never informed of their parents' abilities. However, Teroshe began to suspect they had something to hide. Whenever he confronted his parents at the age of 16, they continued to deny his theories. However, he was sure that his parents were hiding something from him and his siblings, and believed it could have something to do with magic.

Fearing for their possible discovery, the parents of Teroshe knew they would need more power to protect themselves and their family. The two began to experiment with their abilities, pushing them past their limit. This dangerous use of their abilities led to Teroshe’s parents and two sisters perishing in a sudden house fire. Teroche became angry, believing that it was magic that tore his family apart. After that fateful day, he always despised the use of magic.

He soon moved to [[Velus]] and quickly joined up with [[The Registran]]. His hatred of all things magic helped him get assigned to the Caedens. Despite coming from a small town, he was able to quickly rise through the ranks for his ferocity. By the age of 26, he had become the leader of the Caedens. Teroshe despises the policies put in place by [[King Aulus Turochan II]], believing that reintroducing magic into their society will cause it to crumble.
