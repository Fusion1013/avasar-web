She stands at around 5 ft 4 (1.6 meters), but looks shorter due to her hunched posture. She is most commonly seen wearing well tailored dresses and robes, like most nobles do.
## History
Lady Sortelle Armon was born into the Armon family in the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]]. However, she was very different from the rest of her family for one reason: she was born with innate magical abilities. This was a curse in a land where the mere possession of magic was enough to condemn someone to death. Lady Sortelle was forced to keep her abilities a secret, knowing that revealing them could lead to her untimely death.

Despite the danger, Lady Sortelle wanted to learn how to suppress her ability. She began to experiment and practice her abilities in secret until she was able to gain some control over them. Now having control over this ability, she could continue to live her life without fear of persecution or death.

However, as time passed, Lady Sortelle realized that she wasn't alone. There were many people like her who had been born with magical abilities and needed help learning to suppress them. She founded the [[Ordo Magi]], a secret organization dedicated to teaching innate spellcasters how to control their abilities so they could live normal lives. The [[Ordo Magi]] was successful in keeping its existence hidden for many years, and its very few members continued on with their lives. Despite their newly found control over their magic, many of the members were eventually discovered and executed by the Crown.

However, everything changed when [[King Aulus Turochan II|Aulus II]] became the king of the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]]. Unlike his predecessors, [[King Aulus Turochan II|Aulus II]] was more open-minded about magic and began relaxing laws about its existence in the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Kingdom]]. This allowed for the [[Ordo Magi]] to finally go public. They began to try and persuade the populace that magic was good for society. While some were convinced of this, many still believed that magic was a detriment to their society and should be cast out. As more restrictions were lifted, Lady Sortelle was able to start the only legal place in the nation to study magic. However, this was still done under tight supervision of the Crown. She nowadays mostly stays away from the public out of fear of being attacked by those that despise her.

Within the school, Sortelle acts as the teacher for learning to control and use innate magic such as sorcery. This focuses on how to control innate powers to prevent their accidental use. She also teaches how to use these abilities for the betterment of the Kingdom.
