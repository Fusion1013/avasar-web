## Experimental Farming Techniques
The Agronomi have been working on a number of different experimental farming techniques that can be utilized to ensure the nations survival during moments of crisis, such as at times of war.
### Mushroom & Lichen Farming
One of the more promising looking avenues the Agronomi have been exploring has been underground mushroom farming. If successful, it would ensure that the nation can still feed its population during moments of crisis, by having mushroom farms located below major cities. This would make it a lot more difficult for invading armies to cut off the food supply to the city.

Mushroom farming is currently being researched underneath [[Gulstad, City of Gold|Gulstad]], with a few mushroom caves set up deep within the city. The main focus of the experiments is how to grow the mushrooms efficiently, and how to create food out of it that would cover the basic needs of a living creature.
#### New Mushroom & Lichen Species
A number of different new mushroom species have already been developed, all with different properties. However, most of them come with a number of downsides that make them unsuitable for the purposes of feeding the city.

**Mushrooms:**
- [[Lumibloom Mushroom]]
- [[Durasteel Cap]]
- [[Flaregill Mushroom]]
- [[Harmoniaco Fungus]]
- [[Abyssalshade Toadstool]]
- [[Galeshroom]]
#### Accidental Sentience
While attempting some of these experiments the Agronomi accidentally created the [[Hikseta]], a new type of sentient mushroom race. They attempted to discard these failed experiments, but instead the [[Hikseta]] thrived, forming a mushroom society deep below the city.
