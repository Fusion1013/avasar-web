description: Skywing Transport was created to be a solution to the difficult problem of transporting goods across the [[Dragonback Mountains]]. Since dragons are intelligent creatures they do not need riders, though they sometimes take passengers through the use of specially constructed carrier vessels.Skywing Transport has a large variety of dragons that perform a number of different tasks. For example, smaller dragon employees can be used to transport letters, or smaller packages. Employees with larger carrying capacity might be used for big packages, or even for people in rare cases.

## Locations
### Headquarters
The headquarters of the Skywing Transport is located within the upper section of the Myriad, in the city of Gulstad.
### The Holy Kingdom of Maulik
The construction of the Maulik office has been an important acquisition for Skywing Transport. They have allowed them to branch out, facilitating transport all the way down to the So’Dar empire. The condition for this however, is that Maulik extracts a hefty tax on any transportation that happens between their office and the one in So’Dar.
### Turochan Office
This office is the most recent addition to Skywing Transport.
## Major People
### Dragon Accountant
## Rivals
The dragon transportation business does not come without difficulties. Competing organizations that deal with other forms of trade, such as by sea or by land, are eager to undermine Skywing Transport due to the threat they pose to the overall economy.
### The City-State of Drufali
One of these competing forces is the City-State of Drufali. They do not interfere directly, instead hiring mercenaries to perform sabotage. So far, their attempts have been unsuccessful.
