The town of Stenholt lies on the edge of the [[Morgenfryd Fields]], a vast grassland that stretches for miles. It is known for its famous [[Stenholt, Town of Iron#Iron Mine|Iron Mine]], which produces some of the finest iron ore in all of [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum]]. The mine is the lifeblood of the town, providing employment for many of its residents.
## Landmarks
### Iron Mine
The town is known for its iron mine, which produces some of the finest iron ore in all of Saxum.
### Stenholt Monolith
The mine is not the only landmark in Stenholt. Just outside the town lies an ancient standing stone known as the Stenholt Monolith. The monolith is a towering stone structure, almost twenty feet tall, with strange symbols etched into its surface. The locals believe it to be a sacred site, imbued with magical power. Some even say that it is a gateway to the underworld, and that spirits sometimes rise from it during the full moon.

Despite the superstitions surrounding the monolith, it has become a popular destination for travellers and tourists. [[The Saxum Triumvirate#Gertrude Eriksdottir|Gertrude Eriksdottir]] sees this as a boon for her town, as it brings in additional revenue and helps to raise awareness of the Stenholt Iron Mine. However, she is also wary of outsiders who may be tempted to disturb the sacred site or try to steal the valuable iron ore. As such, she keeps a close watch on those who visit the town, and makes sure that they respect the traditions of Stenholt.
