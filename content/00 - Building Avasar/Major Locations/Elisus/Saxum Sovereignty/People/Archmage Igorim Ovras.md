## History
Ovras was born in a small village on the Taundor islands. He quickly displayed an aptitude for magic and was taken in by a mage mentor at a young age. As he grew older, Ovras began to take an interest in the politics of mages and their place in society. He felt that mages were often marginalized and feared by non-mages, and that this needed to change.

After the cataclysm that shattered the [[Taundor islands]], Ovras fled the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]] over the newly formed [[Fracrish Mountains]]. There, he became one of the leaders of a movement that would eventually create the Saxum Sovereignty.

As one of the founding members of [[The Saxum Triumvirate]], Ovras was instrumental in shaping the early years of the nation. He was responsible for the construction of the [[Gulstad, City of Gold#The Myriad|Myriad]], which would become the central hub of the nationâ€™s political power. Ovras also played a key role in establishing the council of representatives from different regions of the nation, ensuring that all areas of the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]] had a voice in government.

Throughout his long life, Ovras has remained a powerful figure in [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum]]. Though he has during his later years taken a step back to let others deal with international affairs, he still remains an important member of the [[The Saxum Triumvirate|Triumvirate]]. He now primarily deals with the magical research that is being conducted below the [[Gulstad, City of Gold|capital]].
