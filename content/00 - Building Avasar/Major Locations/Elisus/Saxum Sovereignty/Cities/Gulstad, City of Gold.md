## Overview
<span class="leftimg"><span class="smallimg"> ![[TowerGulstad.png|175]] </span></span>Gulstad is the capital of the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]]. It is the nation's center of trade, hence the nickname “City of Gold”. Its main exports are various goods made from rare metals, extracted from the nearby mountains. The city is known for its skilled artisans, and their wares are highly sought after across the continents.

The city holds a circular shape, with three layers of ringed walls protecting the inner spire that make up the bulk upper part of the city. The entire city is not visible however, as a large portion of it extends far underground, through a series of large tunnels.
## History
Gulstad was [[1181 APC - Gulstad Founding|founded in 1181 APC]]. It was the first city within Saxum and later became the official capital of the nation. It was founded as the first safe haven for practitioners of magic that were seeking to escape the Turochan Kingdom.
## Landmarks
### The Everstar
Hovering above the city is a massive crystal, referred to by the locals as The Everstar, held aloft by arcane means. The machine that is holding the crystal in its position in the sky is located at the top of [[Gulstad, City of Gold#The Myriad|The Myriad]], within the [[Gulstad, City of Gold#Crystal Chamber|Crystal Chamber]]. The crystal emits a constant bright, yellow light, observed from afar as a distant star. It is said that this crystal keeps undead from breaching the city.

The crystal has another purpose however. It was originally created as a final line of defense in the event of a hostile incursion. Upon activation a dark field would envelop the city for a second, before transporting the entire city to the vibrant plane. The city stays there until the device is activated again. However, the crystal has never been activated. While the arcane theory behind it is sound and has been tested to some extent, it has not been used on this scale before. Nobody knows what ramifications activating the crystal could have.
### The Myriad
The Myriad refers to the large, central spire that stretches above and below the city. It forms the main parts of the city.
#### Hidden City
The Myriad does not just tower above the surrounding landscape. The spire extends even further down below ground. Stretching into subterranean tunnels that form a vast underground network. This lower district is where most common folk in the city live. This lower part of the city is known as the [[Gulstad, City of Gold#The Twilight District|Twilight District]].
#### Crystal Chamber
At the top of the spire is a small-ish circular chamber. It is brightly lit at all times due to the window in the ceiling, exposing the chamber to the light of the crystal hovering above. Three pillars hold up the roof of this chamber, all marked with different colored glowing glyphs. The middle of the chamber rises slightly, with a few steps leading up to the tall pedestal placed in the middle of the room.

Hovering a few centimeters above the pedestal is an identical, but smaller, crystal to the massive one hovering above the tower. The pedestal symbolizes The Myriad, and manipulating the small crystal will mirror the effects on the larger one. A large machine has been constructed around the small crystal in order to protect it. Four thick pillars hold up spinning metal discs that generate a sort of force field around the crystal. There is a small interface at the base of one of the pillars, with a number of levers and buttons. These controls are used to activate [[Gulstad, City of Gold#The Everstar|The Everstar]].
### The Twilight District
*"Welcome to the playground"*

The Twilight District is located deep beneath the city. It is where most of the common population of the city resides.
#### Magical Light
The Twilight District is lit up primarily by magical light sources that have been affixed to the walls and ceilings.
#### Mushroom & Lichen Farming
As most of the city’s food is gathered from surrounding farms, the city could easily be starved by above ground attacks cutting off the city’s supply of food. To protect against this there are currently experiments being conducted by [[The Agronomi Institute]] focused on growing food from underground mushrooms. There are a few mushroom caves set up deep within the city. The main focus of the experiments is how to grow the mushrooms efficiently, and how to create food out of it that would cover the basic needs of a living creature.

While attempting some of these experiments they accidentally created the [[Mýkites Overview#Hikseta|Hikseta]], a new type of sentient mushroom race. They attempted to discard these failed experiments, but instead the [[Mýkites Overview#Hikseta|Hikseta]] thrived, forming a mushroom society deep below the city.
#### The King's Grave
<span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg"> ![[KingsCrypt.jpg|180]] </span></span>*"Forget what must be remembered"*

Far beneath the bustling streets and towering spires of the city lies a somber place of remembrance known as the King’s Grave. This macabre monument serves as a testament to the harrowing history of the Saxum, who endured the hatred of their old people in the aftermath of the cataclysm that shattered their homeland. Here, the past is interred in the deepest, darkest depths, never to be seen or spoken of again, a symbol of the Saxum’s seething anger and resentment towards the new king and his nation. For the Saxum, the King’s Grave is a place of mourning and bitter acceptance, a stark reminder of all they have lost and all that is now forever dead and buried.
### Dragon Port
The main headquarters of [[Gulstad, City of Gold#Skywing Transport|Skywing Transport]]. It provides transportation to the other side of the Dragonback Mountains and up to [[Odverg, City of Metal|Odverg]].
## Defenses
There are three layers of ringed walls surrounding the city. There are eight smaller towers spread along the outermost wall with arcane cannons stationed on top. The inner walls have towers of their own with catapults on top of them. There are two armored gates that lead into the inner rings, one on each side of the city.

Since most of the city is located underground it is well protected from airborne attacks. A significant amount of time has been spent trying to protect the [[Gulstad, City of Gold#The Twilight District|Twilight District]] from underground attacks, such as large worms or similar creatures. While the outermost tunnels have been reinforced with steel, they are still vulnerable to attacks by a persistent foe. To aid in the defenses of these tunnels, most of them have [[Shadow Lantern|Shadow Lanterns]] attached to the walls that can be activated either in sections or all at once by the guard captains.

The city guards can be recognized by their black plate mail, with high rank being indicated by strips of gold filigree on their helmets. Most of the city guards have some knowledge of the arcane, but there are a few groups that specialize in different kinds of magic.
## Organizations
### The Saxum Triumvirate
[[The Saxum Triumvirate]] is composed of three powerful mages who rule over the Saxum Sovereignty from within the Myriad. They are [[Archmage Igorim Ovras]], [[Master Leo Umbras]], and [[Ezorah von Abendroth]]. As the ruling body of the nation, they hold ultimate power over all aspects of governance and policy, though they are advised by a council of 13 representatives from different regions of the country. [[The Saxum Triumvirate|The Triumvirate]] is known for their formidable magical abilities and their unwavering commitment to Saxum and its prosperity.
### Skywing Transport
*"Trust your cargo to the strength of our dragons"*

Skywing Transport was created to be a solution to the difficult problem of transporting goods across the [[Dragonback Mountains]]. Since dragons are intelligent creatures they do not need riders, though they sometimes take passengers through the use of specially constructed carrier vessels.
