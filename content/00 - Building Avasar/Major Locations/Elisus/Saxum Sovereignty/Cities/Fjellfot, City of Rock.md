## Overview
A small city nestled between the Fracrish Mountains, guarding the only traversable pass from the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]] to the Turochan Kingdom. It was [[1197 APC - Fjellfot Fortress Construction|built in 1197 APC]], but did not officially [[1213 APC - Fjellfot Founding|become a city until 1213 APC]]. Fjellfot boasts a formidable army and a near-impenetrable perimeter that expands into a series of defensible weapon posts along the sides of the pass to further dissuade any force from attempting an invasion. The city has held strong for generations without being breached. The city's name is derived from the simple fact that it is situated at the foot of a mountain. The name for 'mountain' being 'fjell' in [[Old Taundorian]].
## History
The city was originally a small fort meant to protect the borders of [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum]] from the then hostile Turochan Kingdom, only letting people attempting to escape the kingdom pass. It has since grown into a smaller city, though it still maintains its original purpose to an extent. The city saw explosive growth after the discovery of the vast mineral veins below the nearby mountain in [[1251 APC - Fjellfot Excavation Starts|1251 APC]]. The city has since grown into a substantial mining city and stands for a majority of the nations mineral extractions.
## Landmarks
### Fjellgruve
Above the city is an entrance to a deep tunnel city, leading far below the nearby mountains. There, miners extract various rare metals, such as [[Fevrus]] and [[Adamantite]], that form under extreme pressure conditions. Excavations in the area were first started in 1251 APC, but didn’t bear fruit until around 4 years later when they discovered the large [[Fevrus]] and [[Adamantite]] deposits.

<span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg"> ![[MountainMineBuilding.jpeg]] </span></span>The above ground entrance to the mines is a large stone building, with a sturdy roof to protect the machinery inside. The building has two large smokestacks, to release the smoke and steam generated by the coal-powered machinery. The entrance to the mines themselves are protected by a set of large wooden doors, reinforced by iron and other metals, to prevent cave-ins and protect the surface against potential threats from underground creatures. There are also magical wards set up around the entrance to prevent unauthorized access, something [[Fjellfot, City of Rock#Magnus Halvorsen|Magnus Halvorsen]] and his colleagues are working hard to ensure does not happen. Outside the building are large piles of coal and ore waiting to be transported, as well as carts and other equipment used to move the materials around.

The mining operations themselves rely heavily on the use of magic. Enchanted pickaxes and specialized tools are used to break through rocks, spells are used to detect the presence of ore veins, all under the guidance of [[Fjellfot, City of Rock#Elin Holm|Elin Holm]], Head of Geomancy Operations. There are also protective enchantments in place around the critical parts of the mines to prevent cave-ins and other such incidents. The one in charge of these enchantments is [[Fjellfot, City of Rock#Lars Pettersen|Lars Pettersen]], making sure that they function as expected.

<span class="leftimg"><span class="smallimg"> ![[MiningGolem.jpg]] </span></span>Magical lights are used by the miners instead of methods that rely on fire, as fire has been known to cause accidents when exposed to various underground gasses. For these reasons, magic users specialized on using earth magic or geomancy are highly sought after, due to their ability to aid in locating and uncovering veins of ore. Specialized golems are also used within the mines, to aid with some of the more physically intensive operations. This can be anything from breaking through rock, to transporting ore to the nearest loading station.

Magic is also utilized to transport ore out of the mines. Carts enchanted by magic automatically move through the tunnels, moving ore and personnel from and to the surface. Near the surface are large platforms where carts are automatically unloaded after which ore can be sorted and further processed. [[Fjellfot, City of Rock#Alina Sandvik|Alina Sandvik]] is the one in charge of much of the above ground operations. She is also partly involved in the further development of the systems they have in place, together with [[Fjellfot, City of Rock#Oskar Bjornsen|Oskar Bjornsen]]. A large amount of research has gone into the construction of these systems and developments are still being made. More sophisticated ways of monitoring these systems are currently being developed under the capital.
