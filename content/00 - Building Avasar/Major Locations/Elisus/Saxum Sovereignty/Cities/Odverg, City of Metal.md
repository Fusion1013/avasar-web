*"Forged in Steel, Built to Endure"*

**Population:** 18.900 (63% dwarves, 16% humans, 11% gnomes, 10% other races)
**Government:** The city is governed by The Big Three, a group of three guilds.
**Defense:** Odverg has a respectable force of citizen militia and mercenaries, controlled by the Overseers. They are there to mainly guard the materials extracted from the rift.
**Commerce:** Odverg is an important center of the metal trading industry.
**Organizations:** The Big Three that form the city’s government.
## Overview
A city built high up in the mountains, climbing on the sides of a massive hole dug into the ground. It has one of the few known permanent portals to another plane, in this case [[Tenebris]]. After the discovery of rare metals within the plane, Odverg was [[1322 APC - Odverg Founding|founded in 1322 APC]] to facilitate the extraction of these materials.
## History
Odverg was originally an outpost that was constructed to investigate a few large caves in the area. After the discovery of a large planar portal leading to [[Tenebris]], the outpost would eventually grow into a larger city. This was to facilitate the transport of rare materials extracted from the portal. The new city was named Odverg, because it was situated over the rift and had a large dwarf population. The city of [[Odverg, City of Metal#Udverg|Udverg]] was later founded underneath the rift, on the other side.
## Landmarks
### Fractured Abyss
The Rift known as Fractured Abyss is located deep below the city, at the bottom of a massive hole. The hole was constructed by the early inhabitants to facilitate easier travel to [[Tenebris]], through the use of elevators. The elevators descend into the shaft, passing through the rift, and emerging on the other side. The rift itself is not visible, instead blurring the borders between the planes at this exact spot. This has enabled the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]] to construct infrastructure in the form of elevators, water pipes and structural support, in order to aid in the extraction of rare minerals from [[Tenebris]].

On the other side of the rift is a loading area, where cargo is loaded onto elevators to the surface. There are also a few water tanks, being loaded through iron pipes from the surface. The water is used to help extract the valuable minerals from within the rock. The main materials that are being extracted are [[Targath]] and [[Aururum]], but caves filled with Dendritic Crystals have also been found and excavated. The mining outpost on the other side of the rift is called [[Odverg, City of Metal#Udverg|Udverg]].
### Distillation Factory
At the top of the rift is the Distillation Factory. It has direct access to the elevators into the rift, and is the landing point for all metals that are extracted in [[Tenebris]]. This is where the metals are processed and purified, before being sent to the transportation building.
### Transportation Building
Used to transport materials to the capital, by the use of a permanent teleportation circle.
### Gloom's Shrooms
Far from the main market square, in a quiet alley, travelers might stumble upon Gloom’s Shrooms. For those “in the know”, this unassuming market stall is a treasure trove of rare items sourced from the vast network of tunnels and caverns that extend for miles below the surface. The shopkeeper, Mr. Gloom, will invite them down to his real shop, if given the correct password.
#### Mr. Gloom
Mr. Gloom is a gray-skinned, short, subterranean gnome. His charcoal suit has seen better days, and in its current state is marred by stains, patches, and ragged edges. His bowtie is similarly worn - what was once a jolly shade of yellow has faded to a more sallow pallor.

Before establishing himself on the surface, Mr. Gloom and his nomadic family made a living as merchants and traders in the tunnels and caverns below. Often, Mr. Gloom contracts his family and friends who still live beneath the surface to aid him in obtaining items and moving goods. Mr. Gloom has multiple storefronts across several different towns and cities, all connected by the sprawling network of underground tunnels.
### Underground Tunnels
Locals of Odverg know that if you pay a few gold pieces to one of the lift operators, he can be persuaded to stop the lift at the middle of the shaft. There, hidden in the wall, one can find one of the entrances to the underground tunnel network.

Since the rift is in the form of a blending of planes in a large area, and not in the form of a gateway, there are locations where it is possible to cross outside of the main elevator shaft. Some of these connect to the underground tunnel network and are being used to smuggle materials to and from [[Tenebris]].
## Udverg
The small mining outpost on the other side of the rift originally didn't have a name, but eventually became known as Udverg. It is however still considered a part of the main city of Odverg.
## The Big Three
There are three primary guilds that govern the city. They are listed in order of importance below.
### The Overseers
The Overseers is the main ruling guild in Odverg, tasked with governing the city and ensuring its prosperity. While the [[Odverg, City of Metal#The Riftwardens Guild|Riftwardens Guild]] is responsible for guarding the planar portal and conducting research, the Overseers oversee all other aspects of city management, including trade, taxation and security.
#### Guild Members
The guild is led by a council of five members, each with their own area of expertise. The exact identities of the members of the council is a closely guarded secret, with only a few individuals knowing their real names.

The head of the council is only known as the High Overseer, and they have final say on all matters concerning the city.

One of the Overseers’ primary concerns is maintaining a steady supply of resources from [[Tenebris]], which is crucial for the city’s economy. They work closely with the Riftwardens to ensure the planar portal is secure and operational, and they oversee the extraction and processing of rare metals from [[Tenebris]].

The Overseers also strive to maintain order and security within the city. They employ a network of guards and watchmen to patrol the streets and keep the peace.

Overall, the Overseers are seen as the backbone of the city, responsible for ensuring its survival and prosperity. While they sometimes clash with the [[Odverg, City of Metal#The Riftwardens Guild|Riftwardens]] over matters of governance and research, the two guilds generally work together to ensure Odverg remains a thriving city in the mountains.
### The Riftwardens Guild
The main purpose of the Riftwardens is to ensure that the rift stays functional, by monitoring and guarding it. They conduct research centered on planar rifts, and construct mechanisms to better understand and control them.
#### Guild Members
##### Thorne Ironfist
Dwarven engineer and head of the Guild’s construction division. Thorne is a master of building structures and devices that can withstand the unpredictable energies of planar rifts, and is known for his gruff but practical demeanor.
##### Lyra Stormborn
Elven arcanist and lead researcher on planar magic. Lyra is fascinated by the complex interplay between different planes of existence and has made several groundbreaking discoveries on the topic, but her eagerness to experiment sometimes leads her to take risks that others find foolish.
#### Research
The original goal of the Riftwardens research was to simply aid in the extraction of valuable resources from Tenebris, but their purpose has grown much larger over the years. They are now not only focused on maintaining the rift, but also on how to create new ones and how to link them to different planes. They have a variety of ongoing experiments and measurement devices constructed around the rift in Odverg, and are currently working on constructing a gateway in their main workshop.
### The Mining Masters
*"Built to Endure"*

(Their logo looks something like this, should probably make a new one in a more fitting style though)

The Mining Masters are the primary ruling guild of Udverg. Unlike the other ruling guilds, the Mining Masters are not highly regarded by the others and are often seen as outcasts due to their isolation from the surface world.

Despite this, the Mining Masters are highly skilled at mining and metalworking, and their expertise in these areas is highly sought after by the other cities.

Their slogan is “Built to Endure”, suggesting that they are capable of withstanding the harsh and unforgiving conditions in Tenebris, as well as implying a sense of resilience and steadfastness among its inhabitants.
