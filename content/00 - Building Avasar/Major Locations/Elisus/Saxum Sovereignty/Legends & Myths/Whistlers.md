*"Beware the Whistler’s mournful song, for it calls to the lost and forgotten"*
## Overview
<span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg"> ![[Whistlers.jpg]] </span></span>Whistlers are spirits, usually described as lost souls, that frequently appear in the folklore of coastal areas in the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]]. Whistlers are usually associated with local legends of tragedy; most versions include a widow who lost a partner at sea; either killing themselves in grief, or dying alone and heartbroken.

These spirits are said to wander the coastline obsessively in search of their dear departed; emitting a ‘heartbreaking’ whistle in an attempt to call their lost one. It is strongly believed you should never approach a Whistler, nor make any noise in one’s presence. Most important of all; you should never look directly at one.

Though usually benign, Whistlers are a harbinger of death to anyone who bears resemblance to the widow’s lost partner. According to local legend, a Whistler will follow anyone who bears likeness - moving closer each passing day - eventually draggin the unfortunate lookalike into the ocean.

There is one location in particular that is said to have an unusual number of wandering Whistlers. [[Echo Bay]] lies in the north-eastern regions of the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]], close to the [[Fracrish Mountains]]. It is a rocky stretch of shoreline, usually avoided by the locals due to the stories of Whistlers and ghosts wandering the area.
## Folksongs, Stories & Poems
Many folksongs, stories and poems have been written about Whistlers. The most popular of which is simply known as “The Whistler’s Song”.
### The Whistler's Song
>O’ pray ye don’t look like he.
>Who fell short of waters’ edge.
>To walk the lines of said shore.
>A fate his widow pledged.
>For most a’ safety is assured.
>No harm will come to ye!
>But pray for those unfortunate souls,
>Who resemble those lost at sea.
### The Seafarer's Prayer
>Oh, Whistler of the salty breeze,
>Who wanders by the shore.
>Please spare me from your deadly seize,
>And let me sail once more.
### The Lost Sailers
A sailor is shipwrecked on a rocky coastline and stumbles upon an old, abandoned lighthouse. As he seeks shelter, he hears the haunting whistle of a Whistler outside. Terrified, he hides in the lighthouse, but soon realizes that he is not alone - the Whistler is inside with him.
## Victims of Tragedy
Sir Harlick-Terr, a young lord of Havdal, was famously believed to be killed by a Whistler. In a diary entry made shortly before his death, it is believed he mentioned his malevolent stalker:
>I had poured myself a stiff drink and must have fallen asleep when I awoke to hear a heavy, irregular tread right outside my form. I watched something dark move beneath the door. I clutched a candle and waved it about frantically, shouting to warn the creature away. It smells like moldy sheepskin, and its malevolence mangles my senses. I remind myself, this creature cannot hurt me - for it is only a spirit”
