## The Scarecrows
<span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg"> ![[EvilScarecrow.jpg]] </span></span>The Morgenfryd Fields are covered in large fields and livestock, and as such plenty of scarecrows can be seen when wandering the plains. It can be hard to differentiate between those that are handmade and those that are not. Scarecrows typically animated through binding with an evil spirit. Any creature could provide its spirit to animate a scarecrow, but different creators had different preferences. Hags and witches, for example, tended to prefer the spirits of demons.

Scarecrows lurk the fields, dormant during the day, hunting during the night. Scarecrows hunt using fear, and the unnerving sight of one alone could terrify its victim to the point of paralysis. Once its target was paralyzed, it would attack using its razor-sharp claws.

The scarecrows are commonly used in tales to scare children, warning them to stay away from the fields during the night. “Stay away from the fields at night, or the scarecrows will get you”.
