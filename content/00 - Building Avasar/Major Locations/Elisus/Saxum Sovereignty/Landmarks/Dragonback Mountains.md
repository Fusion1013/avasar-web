*"Either the unyielding cold takes your; or the dragons will"*

## Overview
The snow-dusted peaks of the Dragonback Mountains separate the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]] from the eastern nations.
## Notable Locations
There are a few abandoned mines scattered throughout the mountain landscape. These were used to extract the valuable resources in the mountains, but were mostly abandoned a few years after the Odverg rift was discovered, in favor of prioritizing those resources. Some of these caves are now inhabited by feral animals and monsters.

#### Blood Glass Caves
![[CrystalCaveLab.jpg|500]]
There is one mine that is particularly dangerous. The Blood Glass Caves were a series of deep mineshafts leading to a large cave containing Blood Glass, a rare type of crystal. What the miners did not expect to find down there was an old workshop, seemingly of arcane purpose. Within the workshop was a particularly large crystal, with something inside. Upon closer inspection the miners saw the body of an old man, suspended within this crystal. How or why the body got there is currently unknown.

They eventually had to stop mining in the cave, due to several miners going missing.
### Ruins of Voidhold
High up in the mountains is an unusual valley, perpetually covered by dark mists. Within the valley are a number of small ruined buildings, which sit in a broken circle around a central space. It looks almost as if the buildings have been exploded outwards, scattered bits of rock littering the ground outside.

In the middle of the formation a black tear splits the air, leaking dark shadow across the stonework. If observed long enough, creatures originating from an unknown plane of existence might be seen exiting the tear and wandering into the dark forest surrounding the structures. While the tear is only about 6 feet tall, it has the ability to expand to allow for larger creatures such as nightwalkers to go through.

The original name of this village is unknown and is now only referred to as Voidhold. There are many myths and legends around what caused the tear in space to appear, but nobody knows for certain.
