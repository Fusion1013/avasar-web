### The Lonely Beacon

Not far from shore, upon the broken islands of the Echo Bay lies an abandoned lighthouse. Legend has it that the lighthouse was built by a lighthouse keeper known as Captain O’Shea. He had a reputation for his uncanny ability to navigate the treacherous waters of the region, something not many dared. This was until one fateful night his senses failed him, the wood of his ship breaking upon the rocks in this shore. He retired to the lighthouse, never stepping foot on a ship again. The lighthouse gained the name ‘The Lonely Beacon’ by seafarers.

However, it is said that one stormy night the captain disappeared without a trace, leaving behind only his diary which contained cryptic and unsettling entries about strange sightings in the surrounding waters. Since then, many who have ventured to the abandoned lighthouse have reported hearing eerie whistling sounds emanating from the structure, and some have even claimed to see the ghostly figure of Captain O’Shea walking along the shoreline, still searching for his lost ship.
