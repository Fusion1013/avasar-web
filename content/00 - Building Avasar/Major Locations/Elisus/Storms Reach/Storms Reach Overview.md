*"We wander in fear, in fear of the storm"*

## Overview
Storms Reach is a large area of plains that stretches between the western mountains, the eastern sea, and the southernmost nations on the continent. The area is sparsely populated by wandering hoards, with no permanent structures in sight. There are ruins from failed attempts at constructing permanent shelter though they are few and far between, covered by plant life.
## History
There was once a large kingdom that had its center within the Storms Reach. It is said that the capital was among the greatest ever constructed. For some unknown reason the capital now lays in ruin, its remains covered over by plant life. Some time later, three immortal dragons emerged from the ruins. Soon a storm began to emerge around them, following them wherever they went. It is unknown if these dragons were what caused the capital's downfall. Many have speculated that this was the case, though no conclusive evidence exists to point one way or the other. Whatever the cause, the loss of the capital eventually led to the kingdom's downfall.
## Environment
The environment of Storms Reach is temperate and humid. The lack of mountains or forests give way for nearly constant winds that howl across the plains, with a never ending storm at its center. The landscape is dotted with ruins from failed attempts at setting up any kind of permanent shelter.
### Plant Life
There are a few forests, with most of the ground covered in lower, hardy, fast-growing plants with deep root systems. Plants with [Tubers](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuber) are common, as they allow the plant to stay in the ground despite the violent winds. A lot of plants in the area are able to be ripped up by the winds, carried to a new location, and keep growing from there.

Since a lot of plants in the area grow quickly, people in the area have been able to survive mostly by foraging the plants.
### The Wandering Storm
An eternal storm plagues the area, wandering around in patterns unpredictable to the uneducated eyes. At its center are three immortal dragons, who seem to be the source of the storm. Sightings of the dragons are sparse, with most inexperienced people that venture into the storm never returning, or never wanting to speak of what they saw inside. There are groups of people that are able to navigate inside of the storm, though they are reluctant to reveal their secrets.

The storm causes buildings to seemingly fall apart, leaving only ruins. When ruins like these have been explored after the storm has passed, weird regional effects have been observed. Pockets of intense heat, objects infused by elemental energies, seismic disturbances, strange underground water sources and aquifers. Because of this, people in the area constantly have to move around to avoid the storm's effects.

A few religious movements have formed around the storm and the dragons.
#### The Dragons
##### Aliog, the Fire Dragon
Resembles a Chinese dragon
##### Geldroi, the Earth Dragon
Resembles a western dragon
##### Namus, the Water Dragon
Resembles a sea serpent
### The Ironwood
The Ironwood is a large forest on the northern edge of the region. It is protected by a group of druids. The cores of the trees are made of Ironwood, which is what has given the forest its name. The ironwood strengthens the trees against the storm, as well as protects it from lightning, conducting it into the ground instead. The druids live inside holes in the ground, deep below the root system of the forest. The roots protect them from whenever the storm passes over them.
## The Wandering Hoards
### The Kingarae Hoard
**Population:** ~800

The largest hoard. Named after their first leader, King Rae. They usually roam the areas closer to the southern mountains, taking shelter within the mountain range if the storm gets too close.
### Vindros Clan
**Population:** ~400

This hoard has tamed the wind and sky to their advantage. They are skilled in the art of aerial combat and travel on specially crafted gliders or even domesticated flying creatures. Usually, they stick to the outskirts of the storm, where the winds are not as strong. They are able to harness the power of the storm for swift and agile attacks at nearby hoards.
### Sourcerer Clan
**Population:** ~300

A bloodline of sorcerers that have developed magic to protect the hoard.
### Temperion
**Population:** ~50

Temperion is a smaller hoard, composed of only around fifty people. This hoard is known for their fervent worship and reverence of the storm. They devote their lives to worshiping the storm and the dragons within it, believing that they are their chosen followers. They try to stay as close to the storm as they possibly can in order to harness its power. They conduct rituals and perform sacrifices to the storm in order to appease it.
