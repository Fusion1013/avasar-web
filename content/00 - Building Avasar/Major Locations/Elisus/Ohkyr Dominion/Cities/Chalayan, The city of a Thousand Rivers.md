## Overview
The city of Chalayan is situated on a large cliff overlooking the ocean. It is a bustling port city with grand temples dedicated to the gods of the pantheon. Intricate marble buildings climb the cliffs towards the ocean, colorful banners with patterns of the different gods fly in the wind. The capital is home to a number of marketplaces where sailors and merchants from around the world converge. The city gets the nickname "The City of a Thousand Rivers" from the numerous underground rivers located in and around the city region.
