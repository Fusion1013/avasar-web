## Overview
The [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]] is a powerful Empire ruled by the [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Queen of Winter]] and her kin. Their capital city, known as Iglice or the Frozen Sapphire, is renowned for its beauty and splendor. The city derives its name from the blue light that it emits in the sunlight, which gives it the appearance of a giant sapphire embedded in the icy tundra. The city's architecture is breathtaking, with towering spires of ice and crystal that seem to sparkle and glitter in the sunlight. The [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Queen of Winter]] rules from her palace at the heart of the city, surrounded by her loyal subjects and protected by her fearsome ice warriors. Visitors to the Frozen Sapphire are awed by its beauty and majesty, but they know better than to cross the [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Queen of Winter]], for her power is as cold and unforgiving as the icy realm she calls home.
## History
A land riddled with war and conquest, Iglice was the birthplace of the [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Ice Queen]]. Her mother, a warrior queen who led the fierce and brutal Iglacian tribes, gave birth to her during a fierce battle in the dead of winter. As a child, the [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Ice Queen]] was trained in the art of warfare, honing her skills with weapons and magic. She quickly rose through the ranks and became a fearsome warrior in her own right, leading her troops to victory time and time again. However, as she grew older, the [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Ice Queen]] began to realize that there was more to life than war and conquest. She yearned for a kingdom of her own, one that she could rule with wisdom and compassion, rather than fear and brutality. She set out on a quest to find a land that she could call her own, one that would be worthy of her skills and strength. Eventually, she came upon the frozen wastes of the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]]. There, she discovered people who were struggling to survive in the harsh and unforgiving climate. The [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Ice Queen]] saw an opportunity to create a kingdom of her own, one that would be based on strength and unity, rather than conquest and domination.
