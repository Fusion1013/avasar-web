This city was once part of a smaller nation that got absorbed by the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]] around a thousand years ago.
## Landmarks
### Docks
A rather sizable dock occupies the eastern part of the city. These docks facilitate transportation of raw ore from the [[Forton#Mining Outposts|Mining Outposts]] to the north. The ore is then further processed within the city, before being transported to the capital.
### Ironheart Workshop
The [[Ironheart Guild]] has a small workshop in the city, dedicated to performing different tests on incoming ore to assure its qualities.
### Mining Outposts
There are a number of mining outposts in the region, operated by the [[Ironheart Guild]]. The outposts are mostly in the hilly area, due to their high concentration of [[Mithril]] and [[Cold Iron]] ore.
