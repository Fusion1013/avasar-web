## Overview
The Frostguard is an elite group of highly trained ice warriors who are fiercely loyal to the [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Queen of Winter]] and her kin. They are tasked with protecting the [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Queen]] and her subjects from external threats, such as invading armies, as well as internal threats, such as traitors and insurrectionists. They are also skilled in the use of traditional weapons, such as swords and spears, and are highly trained in hand-to-hand combat.

Members of the Frostguard undergo rigorous training from a young age, and only the most skilled and dedicated warriors are selected to join the Reavers. Once they become members of the Frostguard, they swear an oath of loyalty to the [[Queen of the So'Dar Empire|Queen]] and are willing to lay down their lives to protect her and their kingdom.
