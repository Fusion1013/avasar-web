*"Magic is not a tool, but a language spoken by the universe"*
## Overview
Group of powerful mages who live and work within the Ice Towers of Iglice. They are highly respected within the So'Dar Empire and are considered to be among the most skilled and knowledgeable practitioners of magic in the world. The Frostweavers are responsible for many of the Empire's most impressive feats of magic, including the creation of the Ice Tower itself. It is said that they are experts in manipulating and controlling ice, and can use their magic to create powerful blasts of frost or to summon icy minions to do their bidding. Despite their power, the Frostweavers are a secretive group, and few outsiders have ever been granted access to their tower.
## History
The history of the Frostweavers is shrouded in mystery, even to the citizens of So'Dar. These skilled mages dedicate themselves to the study and creation of magical tools that aid the Empire. During times of war, the Frostweavers are deployed to support the Reavers and Frostguard on the front lines. The Frostweavers were founded by Krai Lyn So'Cara, widely regarded as the greatest mage to ever walk the halls of the Ice Citadel. Her knowledge and skill in magic were instrumental in the formation of the Empire, and her contributions are still remembered today. When a mage is praised for their intelligence it is said that they have "Krai’s wisdom," it is in recognition of her influence on the Empire's development. The head of the Frostweavers is an important figure who advises the Queen and plays a significant role in the Empire's affairs. It is said that the Ice Towers represent the left hand of the Queen, while the Reavers represent the right. The Frostweavers were integrated into the Empire during its formation, having been a major power in the region surrounding Iglice. They supported the original Queen, whose efforts helped to establish the Empire. Most members now are either brought in by their own magical prowess or are recommended by the Glynlynn Academy to join the Frostweavers.

#### Krai Lyn So'Cara
Krai Lyn So'Cara was not only an excellent mage but also a visionary who challenged the conventional wisdom of magic. She was known for inventing new concepts and ideas, which paved the way for her rise to power and the creation of the Frostweavers and the Towers in the glacier mountains of ice that are now located in the current capital of Iglice. As the aunt of the first ruler of the So'Dar Empire, she had a significant influence on the empire's formation and development.

However, Krai Lyn So'Cara's legacy is shrouded in mystery due to her sudden disappearance. The records left by her before she vanished were unintelligible and filled with garbled text that no mage could decipher. The Keeper of the Tower's office holds the text that is written by Krai, under lock and key. Krai's age is unknown, but it is said that she had pure white hair like the snow that falls in Iglice.

One distinctive feature of Krai Lyn So'Cara is the tattoo that looks like a snowflake on her neck, which glows with arcane runes. Her books on magic are highly regarded and have been distributed all over Avasar. Her works mostly focus on the basics of magic and reinventing how magic is perceived.

Rumors abound among the citizens of So'Dar that Krai Lyn So'Cara is still alive, researching magic in a different corner of the world. Her influence on the development of magic and the Frostweavers remains a significant part of the history of So'Dar.
