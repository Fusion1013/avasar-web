## History
A land riddled with war and conquest, [[Capital City of Iglice|Iglice]] was the birthplace of the Ice Queen. Her mother, a warrior queen who led the fierce and brutal Iglacian tribes, gave birth to her during a fierce battle in the dead of winter. As a child, the Ice Queen was trained in the art of warfare, honing her skills with weapons and magic. She quickly rose through the ranks and became a fearsome warrior in her own right, leading her troops to victory time and time again. However, as she grew older, the Ice Queen began to realize that there was more to life than war and conquest. She yearned for a kingdom of her own, one that she could rule with wisdom and compassion, rather than fear and brutality.

She set out on a quest to find a land that she could call her own, one that would be worthy of her skills and strength. Eventually, she came upon the frozen wastes of the So'Dar Empire. There, she discovered people who were struggling to survive in the harsh and unforgiving climate. The Ice Queen saw an opportunity to create a kingdom of her own, one that would be based on strength and unity, rather than conquest and domination.
