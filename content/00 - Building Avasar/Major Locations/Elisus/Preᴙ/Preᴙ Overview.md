## Overview

## History
Preia was originally known as the Preia Kingdom, and used to occupy a much larger portion of land than it does now. It has been forced to shrink its borders multiple times over the past centuries, due to both conflicts and environmental disasters. It originally formed from a [[The Wandering Hoards|Wandering Hoard]] that originated from the northern parts of the continent and settled in the area. The leader of the hoard became the king of this new kingdom. The kingdom came to occupy a large amount of the coastal areas where the [[Fracrish Mountains]] now are.

The original capital was [[Zhᴎmchug]], and was located on the north-western coast of the kingdom. In 1157 APC a border dispute escalated into a war with the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]]. This war continued for 12 years, until the [[Island of Taundor]] was smashed into the northern coast of Preia, causing much of the kingdom to descend into chaos. This event caused massive flooding and earthquakes. A group of nobles took advantage of this and made a deal with [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar]]. The nobles staged a coup to take control of the Preia military and pulled it back to the city of [[Wrᴎgord]]. This left the capital vulnerable leading to it being taken over by the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Nation]] in 1169 APC and subsequently renamed to [[Dawnfrei]]. In exchange for this, the nobles were allowed to keep the area surrounding [[Wrᴎgord]].

The nation is now only known as Preia and is run by an oligarchy of nobles.
