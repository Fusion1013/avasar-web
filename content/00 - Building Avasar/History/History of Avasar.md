*"It was and so it came to be"*
## Introduction
For a full list of events, refer to the [[Timeline]].
## Origins of the World
Somehow the planes came to be. Nobody, not even the gods themselves, understand exactly how the original planes were created. They simply were there.
## Let There Be Life
Life originated from the plane of life, mostly by accident. How exactly this happened remains a mystery.
## Ascension of Mortals
After a time, some mortals rose above the rest in an attempt to attune themselves to the planes, to gain power. Some succeeded and became gods. At the start, there were only so many planes to attune to. When multiple mortals began attempting to attune to the same plane, one option would be to replace the other god, usually by killing it. Another common approach was to split the domain, thereby creating another plane derived from the first one. This would significantly weaken both parties.

Mortals who attempted to take over a domain but failed would sometimes become powerful fiends or celestials in service of that deity.

However, as the planes continued to be torn apart, the fabric of reality became unstable. This instability began to tear into the material plane, creating regions where small, infrequent portals would appear.
## [[0APC - Planar Concordance|Planar Concordance]]
It all came to a point when one final mortal ascended, splitting another plane. This caused a ripple of planar energy to rock the cosmos. The planes had reached critical mass. The gods decided to come together, and in a unified effort they killed the newly ascended god, bringing the cosmos into balance once more. To prevent any mortals from continuing to break apart the planes and destroy all they know, the gods hid the secrets to ascension. The gods agreed to present a united front against anyone who would attempt to ascend. This event became known as the [[0APC - Planar Concordance|Planar Concordance]], and became year 0 for many of the major calendars.
