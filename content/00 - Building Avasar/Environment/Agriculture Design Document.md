# Agriculture Design Document
## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to explore the different problems that need to be solved in regards to agriculture and plantlife on Avasar, while keeping the extended seasons and general environment of the planet in mind. This document will present a number of questions that need to be answered.
## Crop Cycles & Harvesting
The extended summers and winters would alter the crop cycles and the timing of planting and harvesting. Farmers would need to adjust their agricultural practices to accommodate the longer growing seasons.

The duration of growth stages for various crops would likely be prolonged, allowing for more extensive growth and potentially larger yields. This would require less seeds, but would still consume a lot of farming space. Crops that take up a lot of vertical space might be preferred in certain regions.
## Plant Adaptations
How do plants handle the longer summers? How do plants handle the longer winters? Potential solutions:
- Plants might develop the ability to hibernate or enter dormant states during the winters.
- Seeds would have to evolve to survive through the long winters.
	- They could be more resilient to the cold weather.
	- Plants could produce a lot of seeds to ensure that some survive.
## Seasonal Plant Varieties
Plants with longer maturation periods that can be harvested multiple times could be beneficial.
## Water Management

## Storage & Preservation
Storing potatoes in sand, in a dark place. Dried beans. Frozen peas.
## Creature Adaptation

## Energy & Resource Management

## Agriculture During Winter Period
Some advanced societies might make use of [Hydroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics) to grow plants during the winter. Plants that can grow underground, such as mushrooms. Plants that do not need a lot of sunlight.

Greenhouses can be used to grow a lot of different plants during the winter. Ventilation, should not be too hot to burn the plants. Careful with fertilizer as that can combined with the sun burn and kill the plants. Pests spreading in a greenhouse. Should not water directly on the plants, as that can cause them to develop diseases. Use poisons that plant life is resistent to, but insects are not. A lot of bugs are beneficial though, which could be a negative of the poisons used.

Big greenhouses with artificial light (magical) sources down in caves. Needs to have good ventilation as crops need N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> to grow.
## Regional Growth
### Storms Reach
A lot of wild growth. The thunderstorms increase nitrogen in the air (??), meaning plants can grow more (??). This is how a lot of the wandering hoards are able to survive, by foraging wild plants.
## Soil
Different metals in the soil. Aluminum sulfate, magnesium sulfate, sulfate in general decreases PH. Lime brings it up. Plants typically needs 6.5-7.5ph. Farmers use plants to get nitrogen into the soil (plants want nitrogen rich soil) (legumes).
> The list of nitrogen-fixing plants for agriculture is quite versatile and includes, among others: Beans: fava (aka faba, broad), alfalfa, green (aka French), runner, field, sweet, peanuts (aka groundnuts), soybeans, cream, black-eyed, or purple-hulled beans, lupins, lentils, cowpeas, chickpeas.

> Notable among cover crops (many of which are nitrogen-fixing legumes), buckwheat extracts phosphorus and calcium from the soil. When the buckwheat plants die and decompose, those nutrients are released in plant-friendly forms that can be used by subsequent crops.

### Soil types
#### Clay Soils
Have over 25% clay. Also known as heavy soils, these are potentially fertile as they hold nutrients bound to the clay minerals in the soil. But they also hold a high proportion of water due to the capillary attraction of the tiny spaces between the numerous clay particles. They drain slowly and take longer to warm up in spring than sandy soils.
#### Peat Soils
Mainly organic matter and are usually very fertile and hold much moisture. Seldom found in gardens.

There are three different soil types:
- Clay
- Silt
- Sand
- Stones
- Chalky Soils
- Peat
## Agriculture & Magic
Magic can be used to accelerate prop growth and increase yields. Magical objects could be used in areas to help with this. Magic can also be used for preservation.
