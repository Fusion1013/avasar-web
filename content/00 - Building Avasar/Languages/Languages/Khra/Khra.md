## Overview
Khra refers to a [[Languages Overview|Language Group]] of similar languages spoken in the [[Khatir Dunes]]. It is commonly spoken in both the [[Osirion Emirate Overview|Osirion Emirate]] and the [[Raazhan Dominion]]. Speakers of Khra can generally understand one another, but dialects substantially differ in different regions. Khra evolved from [[Proto-Khra]], though not much remains of the influences from [[Old Avi]]. The Khra languages have been heavily influenced by other languages from nearby regions, and usually contain a lot of loan words.
