## Usage
A shadow lantern contains tiny bits of [[Targath]], suspended in a thick, translucent fluid. The sides of the lantern can be rotated to either cover or uncover the contents. While uncovered, the lantern creates an area of darkness within 60 feet of the lantern.

Some more advanced versions of the lanterns have been infused with arcane magic to allow for remote operation by speaking a codeword.
## History
The Shadow Lantern was originally invented by the [[Odverg, City of Metal#The Riftwardens Guild|Riftwardens Guild]], soon after the discovery of [[Targath]] ore within [[Tenebris]].
