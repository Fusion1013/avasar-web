description: The distilled oil from this plant can slowly re-grow arms and legs. The oil is very painful and low acting, re-growing mere inches of limb every week but is far cheaper than the magical alternatives. The plant is a huge bush with dark red tear-drop berries with white seeds. A mature bush could have over 100 seeds but 1 vial takes around 50 seeds and two days to distil.
