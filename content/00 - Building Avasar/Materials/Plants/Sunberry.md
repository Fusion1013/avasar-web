description: Found deep in dark forests, sunberries are small, round yellow berries with a faint glow. They taste sweet as honey with a mild sour afterbite. They can be distilled into a golden whisky known as sunshine which sheds light with half the intensity of a torch indefinitely. It is very expensive and tends to be served in crystal goblets that can catch and refract the light into magnificent display.
