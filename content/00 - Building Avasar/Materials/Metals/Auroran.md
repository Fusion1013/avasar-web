description: Auroran is a metal that formed within the core of [[Cosmology Overview#Aurius (Light)|Aurius]]. During collisions between the planet and other celestial objects, rocks containing the metal may leave the sphere of influence of [[Cosmology Overview#Aurius (Light)|Aurius]], making their way into the wider cosmos. Rocks of this nature have been observed falling from the night sky of [[Cosmology Overview#Avasar|Avasar]] in the form of shooting stars. If the metal is forged into a weapon, it counts as magical when used against fiends and undead. A skilled blacksmith can use the metal to forge weapons that deal additional radiant damage on a hit as well as armor that provides resistance to radiant damage.
