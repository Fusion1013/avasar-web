description: A dense metal found only in deep caverns of the elemental plane of chaos. It is slightly blue in color, though the actual metal looks like a cloudy white that shifts as you look at it. True Ice is cold to the touch and lets off a slight vapor, similar to solid nitrogen, and is often used in armors and shields due to how heavy and tough it is. Especially aged true ice can deal moderate damage when touched.
