*"Infinite horizons, within grasp"*
## Overview
The cosmos is vast and complex, home to a multitude of planes and existence beyond the moral realm. These planes are connected by the mysterious fabric of the cosmos, and each is governed by its own unique laws and characteristics. Most planes are ruled by gods, some by other powerful beings. Mortals may journey these planes, but doing so often comes with great risk. The planes and the cosmos that bind them together are full of wonder, danger, and mystery, waiting to be explored by those brave enough to venture beyond the boundaries of the known world.
### The Mortal Plane
The planet known as Avasar is located within the mortal plane, orbiting around its star, Taiya. The planes of the multiverse form reflections here, in the form of other planetary bodies.
#### Taiya
Taiya is the star at the center of the Taiya System.

##### General Characteristics
Taiya is a F-type main sequence star (F8.2V). It constitutes over 99% of the mass of the Taiya System. It is mostly hydrogen and helium plus an assortment of various trace elements. Its radius is over 117 times larger than that of Avasar. With an absolute magnitude of +4.32 and an apparent magnitude of -26.4, Taiya is by far the brightest object in its stellar neighborhood and the brightest object in the sky of Avasar.
##### Formation & Life Cycle
Taiya formed approximately 4.3 billion years ago, with Avasar itself forming approximately 4.2 billion years ago. Taiya is expected to exit the main sequence in 2.818 billion years.
##### Cultural Aspects
TBD
## The Avasar System
The Avasar System, in which Avasar resides, is a six planet system. The four inner planets - Aurius, Sahti, Gaia & Avasar - are primarily composed of rock. The two outer planets - Epistos & Yomi - are gaseous; Epistos is an ice giant and Yomi is a gas giant.

The Avasar System is also home to one asteroid belt. It lies between 3.7 AU and 4.84 AU inward of the system's frost line (6.084 AU), and is mostly composed of rock.

Beyond Yomi lies the icy debris disk which stretches from 37.12 AU to 44.97 AU. Many small dwarf planets orbit within the debris disk, most notably Delir at ~39.33 AU.

Models of the Avasar System predict the existence of an additional planet, orbiting at ~2.53 AU; however, no such planet has been found.
### Formation
TBC
### Inner Planets
#### Aurius & Sahti (0.76 AU)
This binary planet system orbits close to the sun. One planet is quite a bit smaller than the other and orbits in constant shadow of the other.

Orbital mechanics can not explain this phenomena, and it is assumed that there are some magical forces involved in keeping them balanced in their orbits.
##### Aurius (Light)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Luminaria]]
**Appearance:** White & Yellow

Aurius has an incredibly reflective surface which would make it one of the brightest objects in the night sky, were it not for its close orbit to the sun. It is only outshined by Gaia, due to its size and proximity to Avasar. Aurius can be spotted with the naked eye when it is not directly between Avasar and Taiya. It can be seen when it passes in front of Taiya, though not without some sort of eye protection.
##### Sahti (Dark)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Tenebris]]
**Appearance:** Black & Gray

This planet is a shiny, black orb with swirling clouds of dark gray, locked in an orbit that permanently keeps it in the shadow of its sister planet. It is much smaller than Aurius, approximately 4x smaller, though it is a bit denser.
#### Gaia (1.2 AU)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Vylmat, Plane of Life]]
**Appearance:** Black & Gray

A watery planet with a temperature similar to that of Avasar. Contains large seas covered in algae, which is what gives it the greenish-yellow coloration. It is the brightest planet, which means it can easily be spotted in the night sky with the naked eye.
##### Calmara (Peace)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Kalament, Plane of Peace]]
**Appearance:** The surface is covered in a thick, white fog.

The fog, which is called Foscastein, that covers the planet is said to give a calming effect to anyone who breathes it in. If someone were to breathe in the gas for too long, they would eventually fall into a deep sleep, entering a comatose state.
##### Sylvanis (Nature)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Feralia]]
**Appearance:** Shifting tones of deep green

Has a deep crater that formed when Merstur’s asteroid collided with it. Most of the planet is covered by forest. Much of the surface is made of thick layers of moss. There is water, though it is usually below the surface moss layer, with trees growing on top of it.
###### Tem (Weather & Seas)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Terozin, Plane of Weather & Seas]]
**Appearance:** Gray & ice blue rock

A small satellite of ice and rock. Remnants of an asteroid that collided with Sylvanis when [[Merstur, Weather and Seas|Merstur]] attempted to attune to [[Feralia]].
#### Avasar (Material, 1.53 AU)
**Corresponding Plane:** The Material Plane
**Appearance:** Earth-like appearance
##### Brudash (Shadow)
**Corresponding Plane:** The Shadow Plane
**Appearance:** Pure Black

The first moon of Avasar, closest to the planet. The Dark Moon is seen only by the absence of stars in the night sky where it rests, or when it passes in front of its larger twin Junon. It is said to drive people to madness with its endless mysteries.
##### Junon (Vibrant)
**Corresponding Plane:** The Vibrant Plane
**Appearance:** White

The second moon of Avasar, furthest from the planet. The White Moon which maintains steady tides. It is the largest of the two moons.
### Outer Planets
#### Epistos (Knowledge, 7.69 AU)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Gnosis, Plane of Knowledge]]
**Appearance:** Gradients of green

The largest planet in the solar system. The swirling clouds of this gas giant take on a variety of green colors that form bands along its rotational axis. The double rings cast dark shadows on the surface. The gas that makes up the planet is mostly sulfur and methane, which is what gives it its green coloration. Due to the high amount of turbulent flow, the gasses are not able to separate into layers as easily as on other planets, giving Epistos its green gradients.
##### Xarev (Lies)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Eatrev, Plane of Lies]]
**Appearance:** Largely yellowish moon with splotches of orange and gray. This moon is the closest to Epistos. It is also in orbital resonance with Verax. The tidal heating within its center from this causes it to be incredibly volcanically active.
##### Ortuvis (Arcana)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Aurora Ortus]]
**Appearance:** Pale blue surface, with clouds of blue, green & purple gradients

The second closest moon of Epistos. The thick clouds that swirl around the pale planet mimic the appearance of a massive aurora borealis.
##### Crasst (Artisans)
**Corresponding Plane:** Sutya, Plane of Artisans
**Appearance:** A mostly grayish moon which seems to shimmer in a gradient of vibrant colors. The moon is covered in bright craters.
##### Verax (Truth)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Vertae, Plane of Truth]]
**Appearance:** Palesh blue icy surface covered in red-orange patches of salts.

This moon is in orbital resonance with Xarev, causing its icy core to become liquid.
#### Yomi (Death, 28.33 AU)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[The Dark Beyond]]
**Appearance:** 
##### Stryka (War)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Stratosia, Plane of War]]
**Appearance:**
##### Logomon (Order)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Orthosia, Plane of Order]]
**Appearance:** Large plains of black and brown, with white poles. Streaks of white cross the landscape.
### Asteroid Belt & Debris Disk
#### Asteroid Belt (3.7 AU - 4.84 AU):
The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the middle of the Avasar System, between Avasar and Epistos. It contains a large amount of irregular shaped asteroids, with carbonaceous, metallic or silicaceous compositions.
#### Debris Disk (37.12 - 44.97):
The debris disk is a circumstellar disc in the outer Taiya system. It is similar to the asteroid belt, but much larger. While the asteroids are primarily made of rock and metals, most objects are made of frozen volatiles, such as methane, ammonia and water.

Many small objects orbit within this disk, including some dwarf planets. Most notably [[Cosmology Overview#Delir (Madness, 39.33 AU)|Delir]] with its moon [[Cosmology Overview#Phenro (Chaos)|Phenro]], at ~39.33 AU.
##### Delir (Madness, 39.33 AU)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Plane of Madness]]
**Appearance:** Looks mostly like a gray rock, with a few black canyons cutting lines across its surface.

Delir is a Dwarf Planet, orbiting within the debris disk at the outermost edge of the system. It has a small moon, Phenro.
###### Phenro (Chaos)
**Corresponding Plane:** [[Kaos]]
**Appearance:** Highly volcanic moon, covered by ash and flowing magma.

## The Ionia Galaxy
**Type:** Sa~Sb

The Taiya System is located in the plane of the Ionia Galaxy - a spiral galaxy about 40,000 light years in radius. The Taiya System orbits at a distance of ~21,300 light years out from the core within the Ionia’s “habitable zone”.

### Stellar Populations
Of the 21 systems that make up the Cardosian neighborhood, 15 contain at least one star and the remaining 6 are made up of brown dwarfs or white dwarfs. Currently, the closest star system to Avasar is the SS01 system - a binary star system about 5.28 light-years away. SS01 is clearly visible in Avasar’s night sky.

Taiya is unusual in that it is the only F-class star in the Cardosian neighborhood, making it the largest. Most other stars are either low mass M-type stars or brown dwarfs.

Avasar has a comfortable mass, radius, density and surface gravity for humanoids. Its structure consists of an outermost silicate crust, a molten silicate mantle, a liquid iron outer core (which generates the planet's magnetic field) and a solid iron inner core. The surface is made up of land in the form of continents and islands, though a lot of the surface consists of liquid water oceans. Active plate tectonics give rise to both terrestrial and submarine mountain ranges, volcanoes, valleys and plateaus among other features.

A day on Avasar is exactly 24 Earth hours long, with Taiya rising in the east and setting in the west. Temperature and polar regions on Avasar are subject to moderate seasonal variation in heating due to the planet’s rotational axis being tilted with respect to the planet of the ecliptic. In the tropics, (24.5° south to 24.5° north), Taiya is directly overhead for at least one day per year, whereas in the polar regions, (65.5° to 90° north and south) Taiya never rises or sets for at least one day per year.

Avasar orbits Taiya at an average distance of 1.53 AU. Though this distance varies throughout the year, Avasar remains at all times within the system's habitable zone - a region of space stretching from 1.19 to 1.72 AU where temperatures are such that liquid water can exist on its surface.
### Atmosphere & Climate
Avasar’s atmosphere consists of mostly nitrogen and oxygen, though notably its carbon dioxide content is rather high. The high levels of CO2 help keep the planet's temperature in a comfortable range. Atmospheric surface pressure and density are at rather comfortable levels. Avasar’s atmosphere is divided into three circulation cells per hemisphere; a Hadley cell extends from the equator to 30° north and south, a Ferrel cell extends from 30-60° north and south, and a final polar cell extends from 60° north and south to the poles of the planet.

At noon, when Taiya is at its zenith, the sky is a pale blue color. Near sunrise and sunset, the sky turns a slightly darker blue color fading to warmer orange hues near the horizon.
### Moon Systems
Avasar is orbited by two natural satellites called Junon and Brudash. Junon raises tides, and due to its angular size give rise to both total and annular eclipses. Brudash, due to being much smaller and much further away than Junon, does not have much of an influence on Avasar in the physical sense.
### Life on Avasar
#### Native Life
The majority of plants on the surface of Avasar have evolved to photosynthesise the peak wavelengths of light emitted by Taiya. As such, most plants on Avasar are a green/dark green color, though other plant colors are also present.
#### Brudash
Brudash is the closest satellite to Avasar.
##### Formation
The formation of Brudash is a mystery that has eluded scholars for millenia.
##### Physical Characteristics
The Dark Moon is seen only by the absence of stars in the night sky where it rests, or when it passes in front of its larger twin Junon. It is said to drive people to madness with its endless mysteries.
#### Junon
Junon is the furthest satellite to Avasar.
##### Formation
It is thought that Junon formed as a result of a collision between the proto-Avasar and another proto-planetary object.
