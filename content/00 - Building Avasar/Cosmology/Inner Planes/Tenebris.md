## Overview
Tenebris is a dark hellscape. Twisting caverns through black rock. Cold, gray mists, accompanied by eerie silence only broken by heart wrenching screams. Most of its names simply translate to Dark Cavern, or Night. This plane represents total darkness.
## Environment
Most of the environment in Tenebris exists underground. It takes the form of dark, twisting caverns through black rock, occasionally interrupted by strange structures buried within the rock. Labyrinthine corridors stretching for miles, inhabited by nightmares.

There is a surface, somewhere far above the endless rock. An empty expanse plagued by a laud, ever-howling wind.
### Lume Cave

An unusually serene spot within the surrounding darkness, the lume caves are forests of mushrooms that spread across any surface. Many of the plants, insects, and animals of the lume caves are bioluminescent, casting the otherwise pitch-black caves in dim blue light. These fungal forests can take hold anywhere and although they most often cover the walls of natural caverns, they may also take hold along ruins such as abandoned cities and temples if large enough.
