## Overview
The Elemental Plane of Chaos is a chaotic hellscape where the elemental forces clash in a violent fury, forming winds of fire, storms of sharp ice, and tornadoes filled with boulders the size of a small house. Not a location one would plan a vacation.
## Environment
There are areas where one kind of element is more prevalent than others, allowing for less chaotic regions.
### Elemental Winds
One of the defining features of the Elemental Plane of Chaos are the powerful, howling winds that constantly plague the environment. These winds mix with the elemental energies, forming large cyclones of water, winds of fire, and flying rocks. Due to the winds, conversation could only be accomplished by shouting at close range.
### Everburn
The everburn is a constantly burning forest that occurs when a forest on the material plane closely borders an area on the elemental plane of chaos where fire is the main element. Instead of fire burning down the forest and leaving a wasteland it instead infuses the forest with the elemental energy, turning it into an everburn.

Though the everburn is constantly burning, the native life is not harmed. Instead, the animals and plants in the everburn rely on fire as much as they do food and water.

To most, the everburn is a deadly nightmare to be avoided, but for many, it is their home in which they could not live without. Many scholars liken this distinction to that of the ocean, inhospitable to most, but the source of life for species such as mere-folk and triton.
## Source of Magic
The Elemental Plane of Chaos can be a source of conjuration energy, though due to the plane's chaotic nature, it is difficult to use effectively.
