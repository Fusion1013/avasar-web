description: Meaning the Dawn Rise, the Aurora Ortus is a frigid forest [[Planes Overview|Plane]], known primarily as the origin of the Northern Lights. Many cultures have different names for the Aurora Ortus, also calling it the Dawn Taiga or Boreal Woods or naming it after the local names for [[Saheir, Goddess of Arcana]]. The Aurora Ortus is notable as the origin of the Northern Lights. These lights are a divine blessing and message of hope that dances across the sky in the colder, northern regions of the world. The vulpine are common in the Aurora Ortus and they are given the holy task of maintaining the northern lights and are responsible for bringing it out of the ground each day.

## Environment
![[AuroraOrtus2.png]]
### Shooting Stars
Shooting stars are a common sight in this plane. It is said that if a creature makes a wish on a star, they have a high likelihood of coming true.
### Extreme Cold
For all its beauty, it is not without dangers. The ruthless cold threatens to turn anyone to ice within a few minutes of wandering the plane without sufficient protection. Sudden gusts of icy wind have been known to cause rapid drops in temperature.
### Starfall
The Starfall is a rare phenomenon that occurs within the Ortus. It is a special Meteor Shower that holds divine power. Creatures witnessing the event might feel themselves inspired, or suddenly imparted with a new wisdom.
### Crystal Forest
The Crystal Forest, also known as the mind forest, seems like a relatively normal forest from above, but once you get a closer look, it becomes apparent that each of the trees and much of the other larger plant life grow out of large crystals known as mind stones. These crystals work as psionic batteries that can create unpredictable effects.

One of the consequences of these stones is that the trees that grow out of them can form a consciousness for as long as the crystals remain. Such trees are often called mind trees. These trees do not speak but can communicate through telepathy, creating quite a literal living forest. The animals within the forest are not granted sentience by the crystals, though they often express minor feats of psionics, such as limited telekinesis.

The crystals in the forest are heavily coveted, though they are rarely found outside of black markets, as there are few open markets to buy what once were thinking minds.
### Resources
