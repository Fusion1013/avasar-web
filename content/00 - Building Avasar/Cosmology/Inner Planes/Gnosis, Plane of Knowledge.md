## Overview
<span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg"> ![[KnowledgeSpire.png]] </span></span>The Plane of Knowledge is a plane largely covered in an expansive ocean. Its only landmark is The Threshold, a large tower over the endless ocean. All travelers to this plane start on The Bridge, which connects to The Threshold. To cross the bridge and reach this vast library, travelers must complete a series of challenges and tests.
## Environment
### Endless Sea of Knowledge
Endless Sea of Knowledge is said to mirror the skies above when the night is clear. The stars twinkle above, and their reflection shimmers on the surface of the sea, creating an otherworldly, ethereal landscape that is both mesmerizing and awe-inspiring. Some say that the reflection is not just a simple mirroring of the stars, but that it reveals hidden knowledge and wisdom. Its rippling waves splash against the rocky shores of the Threshold or the land bridge that leads to the Tower.
### Planar Energies
### Storms of Madness
Throughout the endless oceans of this plane are regions close to the Plane of Madness. These areas are surrounded by large, unending storms. It is said that those who seek knowledge which should not be known sometimes are pulled into madness.
## Landmarks
### The Bridge
This stone bridge leads those visiting the plane to the Threshold, offering unique challenges along the way.
