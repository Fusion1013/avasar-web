## Overview
## Environment
### Radiant Landscape
The landscape of the plane seems to glow with a radiant light. Trees and grass seem to emit a soft, golden light, and the rocks and mountains shimmer with prismatic colors. Travelers of the plane would be wise to protect their eyes, the radiant light is far from benevolent.
### Celestial Structures
The landscape is dotted with strange structures, towering spires and crystalline palaces. These structures are theorized to have been created by the god [[Lu'Syl, Light and Dark|Lu'Syl]], or their divine servants, and seem to serve as places of worship or power.
