## Overview
The Dark Beyond is the final destination for the souls of the deceased. Despite its name, it is not one of the lower planes, it is instead a neutral plane. It was given the name Dark Beyond by mortals who feared death, who did not realize that death is neutral. This plane is not to be confused with the Shadow Plane.
## Layers of Death
### The Shadowlands
The first layer of the Dark Beyond is known as the Shadowlands. This is the first destination for newly deceased souls that have successfully made their journey through the Plane of Dreams. Souls which are not deemed worthy to reach the True Afterlife are stuck within this region.
#### Environment
This layer is a barren wasteland, with twisted shadows and eerie whispers echoing through the air. The Shadowlands is home to various undead creatures, such as ghosts, specters and wraiths, as well as necromancers and other dark entities that seek to control the spirits of the dead.
### The Fugue
The second layer of the Dark Beyond is the Fugue Plane, a realm of judgment and transition. Souls that pass through the Shadowlands are judged by the gods or other powerful entities, and those deemed worthy are sent to their final resting place, while those found wanting are consigned to eternal torment or servitude.
#### Environment
The Fugue Plane is a gray, featureless expanse, with soulless husks wandering aimlessly until they receive their judgment.
### The True Afterlife
The final layer of the Dark Beyond is the True Afterlife, the realm where the souls of the righteous and the damned alike find their ultimate destiny. This region is often portrayed as a diverse landscape of different realms, each tailored to the beliefs and cultures of the souls that inhabit them. Some settings may depict the True Afterlife as a paradise of eternal joy and peace, while others may portray it as a realm of endless conflict and suffering.
## Source of Magic
The Dark Beyond is an extremely powerful source of Necromantic energy, for those brave enough to tap into it. There are usually safer alternatives than the Dark Beyond, though if one finds themself in need of extremely powerful magic, they might consider using this. However, if one is not careful they can easily be corrupted and dragged into the Dark Beyond by the twisted souls that live there.
