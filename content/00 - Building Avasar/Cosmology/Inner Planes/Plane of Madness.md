## Overview
The Plane of Madness is a strange place.
## Environment
Travel to the Plane of Madness is nothing short of a bad time wrapped up in an even worse blanket of unpleasantness. When first arriving on the plane, the smell is the first unpleasant thing one would notice. Next, one would notice the ground to be soft, fleshy, wet, and slowly pulsating, but firm enough to be stood on.

The landscape is of small foothills and mountains that take on a sickly gray color, pulsating ever so slightly along with the ground. Though it might seem like it does at first, the plane does not have a surface. Instead the structure more resembles that of a cheese with massive caverns and tunnels. Most of these caverns and tunnels are too large to see the roof of.

A traveler to this plane will find that the air is breathable, albeit rather putrid and muggy, reminiscent of a rotting pile of meat in the summer sun. The weather is calm, with no reports whatsoever of anything more than a slight gust of warm soggy wind. Temperature is mostly pleasant, keeping a warm temperate zone. There is a form of precipitation, the roof of the caverns dripping with a strange, acidious liquid.
### Gravity Shift
A danger that has been observed at very rare occasions are gravity shifts. These shifts exist as a plane-wide sudden but severe increase and directional change in gravity causing anyone on the plane to be thrown to the whims of the new direction of gravity. One minute you could be standing on a seemingly safe hill, and the next you’re falling up onto the previous roof.

This also means that any liquids on the plane also must conform to the new direction of gravity. Because of this, the roof is always dripping with the same strange liquid that covers all other surfaces of the plane.
### The Wetness
The Wetness covers almost every surface of the plane. This strange liquid is ever present and will dissolve nearly everything, given enough time. Even heavy leather shoes and coats are rendered into sludge in a manner of days.

The following shows how long items tend to last, and the damage that is dealt to those who do not prepare themselves (this is for standard travel).
- Good Leather Clothes - 2 Days
- Steel Shoes/Armor (nonmagical) - 5 Days
- If exposed to flesh not treated - 10 necrotic damage per day
- Wood structures, Crates, Wagons, etc. - Disintegrates 0.125 Inches (3mm) per day
- Metal Structures, items, etc. - Disintegrates 0.030 Inches (1mm) per day
### The Wet Sea
The only known body of liquid on the plane is known simply as the Wet Sea. Due to the Gravity Shifts the location of the sea is ever changing. It always appears at the lowest point of the current gravity. The sea consists of the same wetness substance and anyone attempting to bring a boat will need to protect against it, as it will dissolve through 4X the amount on the shore. (0.5 Inches / 6mm per day).

If the gravity does suddenly shift, one would be wise to ensure that the sea is not above them.
### Numbing Mind
The Plane of Madness numbs the minds of those not native to the plane. Creatures that visit the plane find that their mortal minds shut down most of their perceptual cognition almost in self-defense. It is possible to acclimate to the plane, either by spending enough time there, or by using some kind of magic. Most mortals that have attempted such a feat have perished in the process.
#### DM Suggestion
While encountering or traveling through things in the plane, players only get enough information to know if it’s animal, vegetable, or mineral, and what actions it’s taking. (This can be in the form of the DM describing things vaguely, such as “a quiet structure”, or “a hungry thing”). If a player attempts to glean more information, they get some actionable piece of information (“The structure seems to be made of stones that whisper prayers for peace and would be a safe place for a long rest”, “the creature is a monster made of shards of broken glass that reflects everything you always wanted to forget and it is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage”) but this also exposes their mind to the madness and they have to make a sanity check.
## Levels of Madness
> “I must be the one to go. I must find how to get there again, I must be the one to unravel that place, to learn the secrets. No, No, No, you don’t understand. There is power there, there is something happening there that is unnatural. I… I must go back” - last known words from Ka’lek Bregruin, traveler to the Plane of Madness

>“Must go back, must go back, WHY CAN’T I GO BACK?” - rantings from Planar Scholar Gristin Pathos, moments before his execution

Anyone traveling to the plane will soon experience the madness that comes with it. Travelers who stay on the plane for prolonged periods sometimes state that their feelings towards it turn more favorable. Others state that when they manage to leave the plane, they feel an intense need to go back, losing themselves in fits of rage. Few travelers who have gone back have returned.
