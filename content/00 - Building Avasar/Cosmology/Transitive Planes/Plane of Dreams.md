description: The Plane of Dreams is a Major Transitive Plane that encompasses all Inner Planes, though it holds a particularly strong connection to the Material Plane and [[The Dark Beyond]]. It is shaped by the collective unconsciousness of all creatures. It is a place of vivid and often bizarre dreams.The Plane of Dreams is often portrayed as a surreal and ever-changing realm, where laws of physics and reality are subject to constant flux. Dreams may manifest in the form of living nightmares, idyllic landscapes, or bizarre surrealistic scenes, depending on the thoughts and emotions of those who dream them.

## Environment
The geography of the Plane of Dreams mimics the journey from life to death (or vise versa). The areas closer to the Mortal Plane is where the ‘good’ Dreams live, with idyllic landscapes, full of life. The areas closer to [[The Dark Beyond]] are where nightmares live. It is unknown why the Plane of Dreams seems to hold a stronger connection to these two planes over all the others. Some theorize that it is due to the fact that recently deceased souls need to travel through the Plane of Dreams to reach [[The Dark Beyond]], and as such has a stronger connection due to the frequency of travel, though this theory has never been proven.

The Plane of Dreams does still mimic all the other planes, depending on how close they are at any given location, though the Mortal Plane and [[The Dark Beyond]] have a much stronger influence.
## Source of Magic
The Plane of Dreams is the source of most illusion magic, and is what most wizards draw upon to shape reality to their illusory dreams.
## Connection with Death
It is common that arcane practitioners use the Plane of Dreams to communicate with or even travel to [[The Dark Beyond]], due to the strong connection between the two. The Plane of Dreams is what newly dead souls need to traverse to reach the afterlife.

It is possible to, purposely or accidentally, enter the Plane of Death through deep meditation or sleep.
