*"Divine Intervention"*
## Overview
The phases of the moon strengthen or weaken the borders to the [[Plane of Dreams]], as well as emphasizing different aspects of those planes and the gods associated with them. A gibbous shaped moon indicates a thinner barrier to the negative aspects of the gods while a crescent shaped moon indicates a thinner barrier to the positive aspects of the gods. This effect is strongest during a full moon for the negative aspects of the planes and a new moon for the positive aspects. Clerics and other divine orders will often use new and full moons to perform different rituals and ceremonies.

During lunar and solar eclipses, the barrier between the Major Planes and the [[Plane of Dreams]] becomes even thinner. The amplification of this effect depends on what type of eclipse it is.

Under most circumstances, only [[Cosmology Overview#Junon|Junon]] affects the shifts of balance between the Planes.
## Lunar Eclipses
Partial Eclipses cause the planetâ€™s shadow to appear over the full moon. These are mildly more powerful than a full moon and happen around once a year.

Total Eclipses cause the shadow of [[Cosmology Overview#Avasar|Avasar]] to cover the entirety of [[Cosmology Overview#Junon|Junon]] and for it to shine a deep red. These are more powerful than partial eclipses and happen about every five years.

A Shattered Eclipse is a special type of total lunar eclipse named after the destruction it can cause. An unknown magical influence causes darkness to cover the entire planet for a short period of sky, with the only light source being the deep red coloured moon. This event is said to allow the negative aspects of gods to reach the Material Plane for a very short period of time. This event happens every few hundred years.
## Solar Eclipses
Partial Eclipses cause [[Cosmology Overview#Junon|Junon]] to partially block out the sun. These are mildly more powerful than a new moon and can happen a few times a year.

Total Eclipses cause [[Cosmology Overview#Junon|Junon]] to fully block out the sun with only an outline of light remaining. These are more powerful than partial eclipses and can happen about every two years.

A Double Eclipse, also known as a Sovereign Eclipse, takes place when both moons eclipse the sun at the same time. This is the only time where [[Cosmology Overview#Brudash|Brudash]] affects the balance of the Planes. This event thins the barrier to the [[Plane of Dreams]] significantly, where the positive aspects of the gods can affect the Material Plane for a short amount of time. This event happens around every 30 years.

Solar events are much more common due to a majority of mortals worshiping the positive sides of the gods. The more this balance shifts, the more lunar events would happen.
