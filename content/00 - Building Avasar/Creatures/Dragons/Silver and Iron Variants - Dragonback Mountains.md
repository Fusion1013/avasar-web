## Ideas
- Silver dragons would be more charismatic, Iron dragons would be closer to the workhorses.
- They would have pacts with businesses in the Dragonback Mountains to transport cargo between long distances. Silver would negotiate business deals like the smart little lizards they are and Iron would fly the shipments between ports.
- Could also be a fast travel method for campaigns, but would likely be very, very pricy.
