notes: Heavy WIP, likely going to change formatting and text later on. Expect grammar mistakes or for sections to be nothing but bullet points for now.

todo: We should add some more dragon information to this yall

## General Dragon Information
Every dragon will get its own document, stored in the same folder, that will show exactly where the main populace is and what that type of dragon is likely to do. Those documents are mostly there to give possible future DMs ideas on something they can do. This document, however, is for information on the changes between pathfinder and/or 5e dragons and these dragons. 

This first section is for information that does not fit in the other subsections, such as populace and the aforementioned changes between the settings. Each dragon will have its own subsection in this document, which you can select on the left. The two main subsets of dragons will also have details, such as where they came from, their general makeup, and stuff like that. 
### Dragon Populace
While the singular documents show groups of dragons that will always be in one particular area, like the [[Skywing Transport|Shipment Dragons]] on the [[Dragonback Mountains]], there are always going to be other individuals in other places.
