# Hikseta
## Overview
![[MushroomWithCrossbow.png]]
While experimenting with different ways of growing mushrooms efficiently and speeding up their natural growth cycle, the [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]] accidentally created the Hikseta. [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum]] attempted to discard these failed experiments, but instead the Hikseta thrived, forming a mushroom society deep below the city of [[Gulstad, City of Gold|Gulstad]].

The Hikseta are pretty small, being at most 2 feet tall. They usually live for around 2 years, though some specimens have been observed to live as long as 3 years.

They are surprisingly intelligent, some have been observed wielding rudimentary weapons such as bows, spears or swords. Some are even capable of speech, at a level resembling that of a human child. During recent years they have been seen taming animals, such as frogs and dire rats, to use as mounts.
