## Overview
Within the thick clouds of the [[Elemental Plane of Chaos]]; an elusive colossus exists. It is rare to witness Nyaricath, the Star-Spawned Horror, but it is a sight to behold when seen in the open. It emits gasses from its porous epidermis as natural camouflage, a literal smokescreen to blend into its habitat. It is a mystery to how large these graceful creatures are. Eyewitnesses have accounted seeing their tails extending kilometers without being able to see the end. It is still unsure to whether these conjectures are true or not.
