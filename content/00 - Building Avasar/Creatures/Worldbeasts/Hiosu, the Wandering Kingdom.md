*"What manner of beast carries a city upon its back, and what twisted beings dwell within?"*
## Overview
This [[Worldbeasts Overview|Worldbeast]] appears as a massive insectoid creature with a body that’s covered in a complex network of veins and tentacles. It has tens of legs that allow it to traverse the ocean with ease, and on its back it carries a sprawling city of twisted spires and monoliths. Two spines rise up from its body, looming over the city spires. It wanders the oceans of the material plane, on the planet Avasar.

According to legends, the origins of Hiosu are tied to an unfathomable, nameless horror that lurks deep within the ocean, though a physical form has never been observed. As a result, Hiosu is imbued with an eldritch power that allows it to traverse the ocean and maintain its city in ways that defy conventional logic.
## Origin
Legends say that Hiosu is the spawn of some unimaginable horror at the bottom of the ocean, though the full story about its origin is not known by any mortal.
## Insectoid Inhabitants
<span class="leftimg"><span class="smallimg"> ![[InsectCreatures.jpg]] </span></span>Hiosu is home to a variety of insect-like humanoids that inhabit the city on its back, that are known as Carapacites. They exist in a sort of symbiotic relationship. The Carapacites fight off any threats and Hiosu provides clear water through hollow tubes on its back.

The Carapacites are intelligent creatures and have been known to communicate with creatures on the mainland in the past. These interactions have been brief however, as Hiosu does not like to stray too close to land.

They are descendants of those who, willingly or otherwise, made a pact with the horror that created Hiosu. Their bodies are warped in unnatural ways, and they have been known to possess powers of eldritch origin.
### Hive Mind
The Carapacites are part of a larger hive mind that is controlled by a central intelligence. This intelligence is a manifestation of the unfathomable horror that Hiosu is tied to. The hive mind’s goals are not known, nor is it known if they are of a sinister nature or not.
### Culture
## Physiology
### Water Tubes
These tubes run down through Hiosu’s legs to the ocean below, pumping up and purifying the water through capillary action.
### Incomprehensible Architecture
The architecture of the city on Hiosu is a nightmarish and incomprehensible mix of styles and designs. There are buildings that are made of twisted, writhing flesh and bone, others are constructed from seemingly impossible angles and shapes. The very act of navigating the city can cause madness and disorientation. The city and roads below it almost seems to be a part of the creature they reside on.
## Ecology
## Environmental Influences
As a massive creature that traverses the oceans, Hiosu has quite a large impact on the environment around it. It has been known to disrupt ocean currents and influence the weather patterns of the area surrounding it. Large storms have been documented at the same time and location as sightings of the creature.
## Eldritch Defenses
Hiosu is protected by powerful eldritch defenses that are triggered by any threats to the city of the insectoids that live on it. These defenses take the form of tentacled monsters that rise up from the ocean to attack, or walls of shimmering energy that repel any intruders.
### Past & Future Threats
While the insectoids have done a good job of protecting Hiosu, together with its natural defenses, there are still creatures and forces that pose a threat to the massive creature. The legs are one of the weaker areas of the creature, and are what creatures usually target if they want to damage Hiosu.
#### The Attack of 1127 APC
The most notable attack on the creature occurred in 1127 APC and was able to be extensively documented due to the current proximity of the being to land. The attack was first noticed when inhabitants of the sea town Kou’Thar noticed strange sounds coming from the ocean. As they looked out, they could see the creature surrounded by a brewing storm. Though, this was no ordinary storm. Purple lightning struck from swirling blue clouds that formed a vortex above the creature. The sound the inhabitants were hearing appeared to be the lightning, though it sounded more like metal against metal. Before long large waves reached the shores.

The creature appeared to be locked in combat with another being. Large tentacles could be seen rising from the waters, swarms of flying creatures swarmed around Hiosu. It was not clear who was on whose side. The storm soon encompassed the fighting creatures, obscuring the creatures within, with only their silhouettes visible from the occasional lightning strike. When the storm subsided, no trace of either party remained.
## Landmarks
### House of the Ever-Wandering One
The church at the center of Hiosu is a towering, multi-level structure that dominates the skyline of the city. It is made of a strange, gray-green stone that seems to shift and move in the light, and is adorned with intricate carvings of writhing tentacles and insectoid creatures. The church is composed of a series of interconnected spires that rise up towards the sky, with twisting staircases and narrow bridges connecting them at various points.

The interior of the church is dimly lit, with only a few flickering torches illuminating the cavernous spaces between the spires. The air is thick with the scent of incense, and the walls are lined with grotesque sculptures and paintings of insectoid deities. The main chamber of the church is dominated by a massive stone altar, which is adorned by strange offerings.

The inhabitants of Hiosu gather at the church for a variety  of rites and rituals, which are shrouded in secrecy from outsiders. Some of the rituals involve the consumption of strange, otherworldly substances, while others involve intricate dances and chanting. The Carapacites believe that by performing these rituals, they are strengthening their bond with Hiosu and the unfathomable horror that it is tied to.

There are many myths and legends about this church. Some believe that the Carapacites worship a being known as the High Priestess, who is said to reside within the highest spire of the church. Others believe that the church is a gateway to another plane, and that the rituals performed there are meant to summon forth unspeakable horrors from beyond the veil of reality.
