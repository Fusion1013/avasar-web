## Overview
This [[Worldbeasts Overview|Worldbeast]] looks like a massive, tentacled monster with rows of razor-sharp teeth and eyes that glow in the dark. It resides in the deepest trenches of the oceans of [[Terozin, Plane of Weather & Seas|Terozin]] and legends say that it was born from the nightmares of sailors lost at sea. Its roar can summon tsunamis and its tentacles can crush even the strongest of ships.
