## Introduction
Welcome to the World of Avasar! The current year is 1378 APC.
## History
Main Page: [[History of Avasar]]

Nobody, not even the [[Pantheon Overview|Gods]], understand exactly how the original planes came to be. However, what is known is that mortals came to exist on the material plane. At this point in time, the gods did not exist. Instead, they were created when some powerful mortals transcended into a representation of a core ideal of another plane. After a certain amount of mortals did this, an event known as the [[0APC - Planar Concordance|Planar Concordance]] caused the gods to hide the knowledge and prevent anyone else from doing such a thing. This event became year 0 for many of the major calendars.
## Regions
### Elisus
Main Page: [[Elisus Overview]]

A continent shattered by conflict, both ancient and new. The western slopes of the [[Fracrish Mountains]] offer shelter to the [[Turochan Kingdom Overview|Turochan Kingdom]], a realm torn asunder in a conflict with the gods and magic. At the eastern base, remnants from a civilization lost to calamity dwell as a nomadic tribe. The [[Saxum Sovereignty Overview|Saxum Sovereignty]], hidden in their impenetrable cities, are divided from neighbouring nations by the [[Dragonback Mountains]], a natural barrier of stone and metal. In the south, tensions rise between the [[So'Dar Empire Overview|So'Dar Empire]] and the [[The Holy Kingdom of Maulik Overview|Holy Kingdom of Maulik]]. A war is brewing. [[Preᴙ Overview|Preᴙ]], trapped between the two nations, try their best to avoid getting involved in the conflict. Meanwhile, to the north, [[The Wandering Hoards]] prowl the plains, guarding their territory with an iron fist. The powerful navy of the [[Ohkyr Dominion Overview|Ohkyr Dominion]] guards the northern coastlines.
### Separi
Main Page: [[Separi Overview]]

The continent known as Separi lies just to the east of [[Elisus Overview|Elisus]], connected by the [[City-State of Drufali Overview|City-State of Drufali]]. Tensions run high between Drufali and its neighbour, the [[Osirion Emirate Overview|Osirion Emirate]], which Drufali used to be a part of, before the civil war. The Dominion now occupies most of the southern desert, with small settlements dotted around the many oasis' in the area. To the east wanderers may find themselves entering the [[Siar Wilds]], a vast jungle in the shadow of the mountain range. Within these jungles, the mysterious members of the [[Akmé Hegemony Overview|Akmé Hegemony]] hides from prying eyes. These druids have tamed the jungles, and managed to harness the planar energies that run rampant in the area. On the other side of the mountain range, within the vast deserts, [[Raazhan Dominion Overview|The Raazhan Dominion]] makes it home.

## Pantheon
Main Page: [[Pantheon Overview]]

Within the world of Avasar, there are a total of 15 different prime deities. Each prime god has been tied to one of the major planes within the cosmology of Avasar. Only these beings are considered to be part of the main Pantheon. However, other beings such as demi-gods do exist. They are instead attuned to a demiplane or something similar. The deities are former mortals who were able to be bound to one of the original major planes. No singular prime deity is good or evil. Instead, they are pure representations of the domain they control. This includes any of the positive and negative aspects within that domain.
## Cosmology
Main Page: [[Planes Overview]]
### Overview
The cosmos is vast and complex, home to a multitude of planes and existence beyond the moral realm. These planes are connected by the mysterious fabric of the cosmos, and each is governed by its own unique laws and characteristics. Most planes are ruled by gods, some by other powerful beings. Mortals may journey these planes, but doing so often comes with great risk. The planes and the cosmos that bind them together are full of wonder, danger, and mystery, waiting to be explored by those brave enough to venture beyond the boundaries of the known world.
### The Mortal Plane
The planet known as [[Cosmology Overview#Avasar|Avasar]] is located within the mortal plane, orbiting around its star, [[Cosmology Overview#Taiya|Taiya]]. The planes of the multiverse cast reflections here, in the form of other planetary bodies.
